# sig_team_discipline_cards_midfield_enforcement

## Purpose

Flags match-team cases where the central-midfield unit drives a high share of the team's foul volume, surfacing enforcement-heavy midfield behavior.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_central_midfielder_fouls_committed >= 10`
- Central midfielders are identified via `silver.match_personnel` where `usual_playing_position_id = 2`.
- Midfielder foul contribution is sourced from `silver.player_match_stat.fouls_committed` and aggregated by side.
- Trigger is evaluated symmetrically for `home` and `away`, then enriched with bilateral card, foul, defensive-action, and possession context.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_discipline_cards_midfield_enforcement.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_discipline_cards_midfield_enforcement.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_discipline_cards_midfield_enforcement`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_discipline_cards_midfield_enforcement.py
```
