# sig_match_possession_passing_clean_game

## Purpose

Triggers for matches with very low combined turnover volume, surfacing clean possession games where both sides limit avoidable ball losses.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `match_total_turnovers < 50` from full-match (`period = 'All'`) team stats.
- Turnover proxy definition: `failed_passes + failed_dribbles`, where `failed_passes = max(pass_attempts - accurate_passes, 0)` and `failed_dribbles = max(dribble_attempts - successful_dribbles, 0)`.
- Emits one row per side (`triggered_side` = `home` and `away`) so team-centric consumers can interpret the same clean-game profile from each tactical orientation.
- Enriches the trigger with bilateral turnover decomposition, passing quality, dribble security, possession share, shot context, and xG context.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_possession_passing_clean_game.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_clean_game.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_possession_passing_clean_game`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_clean_game.py
```

## Output Schema

| `opponent_possession_pct` | Opponent possession share (%) | Football developer: bilateral control-share comparator. |
| `triggered_team_total_shots` | Triggered side total shots | Football developer: attacking-volume context around clean possession. |
| `opponent_total_shots` | Opponent total shots | Football developer: bilateral attacking-volume comparator. |
| `triggered_team_touches_opposition_box` | Triggered side touches in opponent box | Football developer: penetration context in low-turnover games. |
| `opponent_touches_opposition_box` | Opponent touches in triggered-side box | Football developer: bilateral penetration comparator. |

| `opponent_xg` | Opponent expected goals | Football developer: bilateral chance-quality comparator. |
| `xg_gap` | Triggered side xG minus opponent xG | Football developer: net chance-quality edge despite shared ball security. |
