# sig_player_possession_passing_corner_specialist

## Purpose

Triggers when a player creates more than 1 chance from corner-kick deliveries in a single match, identifying dead-ball delivery specialists who repeatedly generate shots.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_corner_chances_created > 1`
- Trigger is computed from `silver.shot` rows where `situation = 'FromCorner'` and the player is recorded as `assist_player_id`, capturing shot-creating corner deliveries.
- Signal keeps bilateral team/opponent context via `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) and adds corner-shot team context from `silver.shot`.
- Output stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_player_possession_passing_corner_specialist.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_corner_specialist.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_possession_passing_corner_specialist`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_corner_specialist.py
```
