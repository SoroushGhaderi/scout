# sig_player_shooting_goals_midfield_sniper

## Purpose

Detects rare match-player events where a central-midfielder proxy delivers a long-range brace, surfacing high-impact midfield finishing from outside-box shooting locations.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Outside-box goals are derived from `silver.shot` with `is_from_inside_box = 0`, `is_goal = 1`, and `is_own_goal = 0`.
  - Signal fires at `triggered_player_outside_box_goals >= 2`.
  - Central-midfielder scope follows current project role taxonomy proxy:
    - `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id = 2` (midfielder)
    - `triggered_player_position_id != 3` (exclude forward deployment)
- Identity and orientation:
  - Player identity is preserved via `triggered_player_*`.
  - Team/opponent identity is preserved via `triggered_team_*`, `opponent_team_*`, and `triggered_side`.
- Match-context enrichment:
  - Trigger evidence comes from shot-level aggregates at `match_id + player_id + team_id`.
  - Player totals come from `silver.player_match_stat`.
  - Bilateral context is sourced from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) and `silver.match`.
- Similarity gate note:
  - Closest active signals are `sig_player_shooting_goals_long_range_specialist` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_xg_accumulator_midfielder`; this signal is distinct because it jointly requires (1) a midfield role proxy and (2) a strict outside-box brace threshold (`>= 2` goals).
