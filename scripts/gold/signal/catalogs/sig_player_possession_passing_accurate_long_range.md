# sig_player_possession_passing_accurate_long_range

## Purpose

Triggers when a player completes at least 10 accurate long balls with more than 80% long-ball success rate, identifying high-precision long-ball specialists.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_accurate_long_balls >= 10`
  - `triggered_player_long_ball_success_rate_pct > 80`
- Trigger is computed from player-level full-match passing totals in `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Signal includes bilateral team/opponent long-ball and pass-quality context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to distinguish isolated player quality from broader team directness.
- Output explicitly stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_player_possession_passing_accurate_long_range.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_accurate_long_range.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_possession_passing_accurate_long_range`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_accurate_long_range.py
```
