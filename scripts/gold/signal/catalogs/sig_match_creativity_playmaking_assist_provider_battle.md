# sig_match_creativity_playmaking_assist_provider_battle

## Purpose

Detect finished matches where creator output is concentrated in multiple elite assist providers,
requiring at least two distinct players across the match to each record `2+` assists.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `match_players_with_two_plus_assists >= 2`
  - where player-level assists are aggregated from `silver.player_match_stat` at
    `match_id + team_id + player_id` grain.
- Match scope:
  - `silver.match.match_finished = 1`
  - `silver.period_stat.period = 'All'`
  - `match_id > 0`
- Distinct-player requirement:
  - only valid player IDs (`player_id > 0`) are counted,
  - and the threshold is applied on count of distinct players meeting `assists >= 2`.
- Side orientation:
  - emits one row per side (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) with symmetric
    `triggered_team_*` vs `opponent_*` context.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_playmaker_showdown` is the closest match-level creativity sibling, but it triggers on bilateral key-pass floor (`>= 5`) rather than multi-player assist braces.
  - `sig_player_creativity_playmaking_assist_brace` overlaps on individual threshold (`2+ assists`) but is player-grain, not match-level bilateral output.
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_the_creativity_clash` is bilateral team xA-threshold logic, not direct realized-assist concentration.
