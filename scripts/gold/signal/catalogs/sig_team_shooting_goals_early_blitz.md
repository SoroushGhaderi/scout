# sig_team_shooting_goals_early_blitz

## Purpose

Detect team-level explosive starts where a side produces an early two-goal burst inside the first 15 effective minutes.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: team records at least two non-own-goal events with `goal_effective_minute <= 15`.
- Triggered rows are side-oriented (`triggered_side`) and remain bilateral (`triggered_team_*` vs `opponent_*`) for tactical interpretation.
- Early-phase context captures first and second goal timing plus the gap between them (`minutes_between_first_two_goals_first_15`).
- Match-level context adds shooting, chance quality, possession, and passing baselines to assess whether the blitz came from sustainable dominance or short-run finishing variance.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_player_shooting_goals_rapid_brace` and `sig_team_shooting_goals_shooting_gallery`; this signal is distinct because it is team-triggered and explicitly time-windowed to early-match scoring bursts.
