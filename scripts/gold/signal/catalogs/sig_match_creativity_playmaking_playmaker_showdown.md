# sig_match_creativity_playmaking_playmaker_showdown

## Purpose

Detect bilateral creator duels where each team has at least one player producing high-volume key passes (`>= 5`) in the same finished match.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger conditions:
  - `home_top_playmaker_key_passes >= 5`
  - `away_top_playmaker_key_passes >= 5`
  - `match_finished = 1`, `period = 'All'`, `match_id > 0`
- Player key passes are sourced from `silver.player_match_stat.chances_created` and aggregated at `match_id + team_id + player_id` grain.
- A deterministic top playmaker per team is selected with `argMax` ordered by:
  - `player_key_passes` desc
  - `player_expected_assists` desc
  - `player_assists` desc
  - `player_id` asc tie-break
- Output emits two rows per qualified match (`triggered_side = home|away`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain with symmetric `triggered_team_*` vs `opponent_*` metrics.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_the_creativity_clash` is closest match-level sibling but triggers on bilateral team xA floors (`>= 1.5`) rather than player-level key-pass floors.
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_big_chance_fest` is match-event-volume driven (combined big chances), not specific to top individual creators.
  - `sig_player_creativity_playmaking_maestro_output` shares the same key-pass floor (`>= 5`) but is single-player output, not bilateral team-vs-team showdown logic.
