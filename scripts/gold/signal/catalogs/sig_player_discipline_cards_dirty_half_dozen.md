# sig_player_discipline_cards_dirty_half_dozen

## Purpose

Flags players with extreme foul volume and zero tackle wins, surfacing high-contact defensive profiles that disrupt play without producing clean ball-winning outcomes.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_fouls_committed >= 6`
  - `triggered_player_tackles_won = 0`
- Player foul/tackle context is sourced from `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Player card context is sourced from `silver.card` at `match_id + player_id` grain.
- Bilateral team context (fouls, cards, tackles won, duels won, possession) is sourced from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) using symmetric `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` fields.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_player_discipline_cards_dirty_half_dozen.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_discipline_cards_dirty_half_dozen.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_discipline_cards_dirty_half_dozen`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_discipline_cards_dirty_half_dozen.py
```
