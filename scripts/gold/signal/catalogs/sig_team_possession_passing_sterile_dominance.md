# sig_team_possession_passing_sterile_dominance

## Purpose

Detect teams that dominate possession (`>70%`) but create zero big chances, signaling sterile circulation without high-quality attacking outcomes.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Signal name source: `-- Signal: sig_team_possession_passing_sterile_dominance`
- Trigger condition source: `-- Trigger: possession > 70 and big_chances = 0 for the triggered team in full-match period stats.`
- Triggered rows are side-specific (`home`/`away`) and preserve symmetric tactical context for passing control, shot output, chance quality, and territorial progression.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_sterile_dominance.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_sterile_dominance.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_sterile_dominance`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_sterile_dominance.py
```
