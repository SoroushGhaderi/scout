# sig_match_possession_passing_keeper_playmaking_battle

## Purpose

Triggers when both sides’ goalkeepers exceed high pass volume in the same match, surfacing goalkeeper-driven circulation battles where build-up is heavily routed through the last line.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: home goalkeeper pass attempts `> 40` and away goalkeeper pass attempts `> 40`.
- Goalkeeper identity per team is selected as the goalkeeper with the maximum `total_passes` in that match.
- Emits one row per side (`triggered_side` = `home` and `away`) so the same match trigger can be consumed in team-oriented downstream models.
- Enriches with bilateral goalkeeper efficiency and share-of-team-passing, plus team pass/possession/own-half/long-ball context to separate controlled build-up duels from forced recycling.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_possession_passing_keeper_playmaking_battle.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_keeper_playmaking_battle.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_possession_passing_keeper_playmaking_battle`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_keeper_playmaking_battle.py
```
