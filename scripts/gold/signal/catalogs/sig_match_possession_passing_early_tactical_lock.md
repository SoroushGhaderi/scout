# sig_match_possession_passing_early_tactical_lock

## Purpose

Triggers matches where both teams fail to register a shot on target in the opening 30 minutes, surfacing early tactical lock phases with suppressed direct threat.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `home_first_30_shots_on_target = 0` and `away_first_30_shots_on_target = 0`.
- Operational first-30 window: `silver.shot.minute <= 30`.
- Emits one row per side (`triggered_side` = `home` and `away`) so team-centric consumers can evaluate the same locked opening phase from each tactical orientation.
- Enriches the trigger with early shot activity, full-match shooting output, passing quality, possession share, territorial progression, and xG context.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_possession_passing_early_tactical_lock.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_early_tactical_lock.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_possession_passing_early_tactical_lock`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_early_tactical_lock.py
```
