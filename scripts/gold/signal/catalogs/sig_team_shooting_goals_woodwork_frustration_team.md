# sig_team_shooting_goals_woodwork_frustration_team

## Purpose

Detect team matches where one side repeatedly hits the post/crossbar (`>= 3` woodwork hits), surfacing frustrated finishing profiles despite meaningful shot and chance creation.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_shots_woodwork >= 3`
- Trigger is evaluated on finished matches only using full-match aggregates from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`).
- Signal keeps bilateral context with symmetric `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` metrics for woodwork burden, shot quality, conversion, possession, circulation, and pressure context.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_match_shooting_goals_unlucky_game`, `sig_team_shooting_goals_wasteful_box_presence`, and `sig_team_shooting_goals_conversion_collapse`; this signal intentionally coexists because it is team-side trigger-first on own woodwork volume (`>= 3`) rather than combined match woodwork, box-touch-plus-zero-goal criteria, or high on-target/low-goal conversion collapse.
