# sig_match_possession_passing_set_piece_dominance

## Purpose

Triggers when restart-led passing volume dominates the match, flagging games where dead-ball circulation is an unusually large share of total passing.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `match_dead_ball_restart_pass_share_pct > 15` (proxy-calibrated threshold).
- The restart pass metric is modeled as `player_throws + corners` at team level, summed to match level.
- Because explicit free-kick pass counts are not available in `silver.period_stat`, this is a conservative proxy for dead-ball restart passing.
- The original intended tactical trigger is “>20% of match passes from dead-ball restarts”; in current data, this proxy peaks below 20%, so 15% is used as the closest operational threshold.
- Emits one row per side (`triggered_side in {'home','away'}`) so downstream users can analyze match-level trigger with side-oriented context.
- Adds bilateral context for pass quality, set-piece shot volume, set-play xG, possession, and shot output.

## Technical Assets
