# sig_team_possession_passing_cross_accuracy_peak

## Purpose

Detect teams that pair meaningful crossing volume with high delivery precision, then profile whether that accurate crossing phase also translated into territorial control and chance-quality edge.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Signal name source: `-- Signal: sig_team_possession_passing_cross_accuracy_peak`
- Trigger condition source: `-- Trigger: Team completes >= 10 crosses with > 40% cross accuracy.`
- Trigger checks both conditions on full-match stats (`period = 'All'`) for each side independently.
- Closest existing signal is `sig_team_possession_passing_cross_spam` (high crossing volume regardless of quality); this signal instead emphasizes efficient crossing execution and can coexist as a quality-oriented counterpart.
- Output remains bilateral (`triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*`) to preserve tactical interpretation beyond one-sided volume counts.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_cross_accuracy_peak.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_cross_accuracy_peak.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_cross_accuracy_peak`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_cross_accuracy_peak.py
```
