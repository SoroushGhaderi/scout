# sig_player_possession_passing_midfield_workhorse

## Purpose

Triggers when a midfielder combines high-volume on-ball involvement with strong ball-winning output, identifying true all-phase midfield workhorses.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id = 2` (midfielder filter)
  - `triggered_player_total_touches >= 90`
  - `triggered_player_recoveries >= 10`
- Midfielder role scope is sourced from `silver.match_personnel` and preserved via `triggered_player_position_id` and `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id`.
- Trigger uses full-match player totals from `silver.player_match_stat` for touches, recoveries, defensive actions, and passing output.
- Signal includes bilateral passing, own-half circulation, and possession context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to separate individual workhorse behavior from team style.
- Output stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_player_possession_passing_midfield_workhorse.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_midfield_workhorse.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_possession_passing_midfield_workhorse`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_midfield_workhorse.py
```
