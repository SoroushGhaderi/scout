# sig_match_discipline_cards_the_disciplined_siege

## Purpose

Flags match-team cases where one side dominates the ball (at least 75% possession) while the opponent repeatedly interrupts play with very high foul volume (at least 25 fouls).

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_possession_pct >= 75`
  - `opponent_fouls_committed >= 25`
- Trigger orientation (`triggered_side`) is assigned to the side with higher full-match possession (`period = 'All'`), with home-side precedence on equal possession.
- Possession, foul, card, and defensive context are retained bilaterally to evaluate whether the siege was productive or mainly neutralized by tactical fouling.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_discipline_cards_the_disciplined_siege.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_the_disciplined_siege.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_discipline_cards_the_disciplined_siege`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_the_disciplined_siege.py
```
