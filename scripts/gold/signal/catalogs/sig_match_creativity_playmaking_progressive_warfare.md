# sig_match_creativity_playmaking_progressive_warfare

## Purpose

Detect bilateral creativity battles where match-level progression volume is extreme, using directional
proxy metrics when explicit progressive-pass counts are not available in current source tables.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `(home_passes_final_third + away_passes_final_third) > 80`
  - OR `(long_ball_attempts_home + long_ball_attempts_away) > 80`
  - with `period = 'All'`, `match_finished = 1`, and valid `match_id`.
- Proxy replacement contract:
  - Player/team progression proxy: `silver.player_match_stat.passes_final_third` aggregated by team.
  - Team directness proxy: `silver.period_stat.long_ball_attempts_{home|away}`.
- Trigger-path audit fields preserve which proxy fired:
  - `match_combined_directional_proxy_source`
  - `match_combined_directional_proxy_value`
- One row per side is emitted (`home`, `away`) for canonical `match_team` grain and symmetric
  downstream modeling.
- Similarity gate note:
  - Closest active match-level sibling is `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_the_creativity_clash`, but that trigger is bilateral xA (`>= 1.5` each) rather than progression-volume proxies.
  - `sig_match_possession_passing_keeper_playmaking_battle` also uses long-ball context, but it is goalkeeper- and possession-focused, not creativity/playmaking progression warfare.
  - Player-level analogs (`sig_player_creativity_playmaking_line_breaker`, `sig_player_creativity_playmaking_box_to_box_playmaker`) share the same proxy strategy but are `match_player` rather than match-team bilateral rows.
