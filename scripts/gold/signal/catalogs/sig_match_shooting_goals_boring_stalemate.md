# sig_match_shooting_goals_boring_stalemate

## Purpose

Detect goalless matches with extremely low combined chance quality and provide bilateral team context for shot creation, territorial access, and circulation quality in stale game states.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `coalesce(home_score, 0) = 0`, `coalesce(away_score, 0) = 0`, and `coalesce(expected_goals_home, 0) + coalesce(expected_goals_away, 0) < 0.50` at `period = 'All'`.
- Emits two side-oriented rows per triggered match (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain.
- Enrichment keeps the low-event profile explainable via bilateral shot volume, shot precision, big-chance activity, penalty-box touches, possession split, and pass accuracy.
- Similarity gate note: nearest active signals are `sig_match_shooting_goals_goal_fest` and `sig_match_possession_passing_dead_zone_game`; this signal remains distinct because it is explicitly anchored on *both* goalless outcome and strict low combined xG (`< 0.50`) rather than high-goal explosions or zero-box-touch proxies.
