# sig_player_shooting_goals_distance_threat

## Purpose

Detects match-player events where a player produces heavy outside-box shot volume (`>= 5`), identifying distance-heavy attacking profiles regardless of whether goals were scored.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Outside-box scope is defined with `is_from_inside_box = 0` in `silver.shot`.
  - Shot events exclude own goals (`is_own_goal = 0`).
  - Signal fires when `triggered_player_outside_box_shots >= 5` in the same finished match.
- Identity and orientation:
  - Player identity is preserved via `triggered_player_*`.
  - Team/opponent identity is preserved via `triggered_team_*`, `opponent_team_*`, and `triggered_side`.
- Match-context enrichment:
  - Shot-location trigger evidence is aggregated from `silver.shot` at `match_id + player_id + team_id` grain.
  - Player total shooting context comes from `silver.player_match_stat`.
  - Bilateral team/opponent context comes from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) and `silver.match`.
- Similarity gate note:
  - Closest active shooting-goals signals are `sig_player_shooting_goals_long_range_specialist` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_shot_volume_monster`; this signal is intentionally distinct because it is outside-box volume-first (distance profile) rather than outside-box goal conversion or total-shot volume.
