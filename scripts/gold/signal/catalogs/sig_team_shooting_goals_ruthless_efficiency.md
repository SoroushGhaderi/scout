# sig_team_shooting_goals_ruthless_efficiency

## Purpose

Flags teams that produce high goal output from a very low on-target shot volume, capturing extreme finishing efficiency events that often outperform chance volume.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_goals >= 3`
  - `triggered_team_shots_on_target <= 5`
- Trigger evaluation is based on full-match team stats (`period = 'All'`) for finished matches only.
- Tactical enrichment stays bilateral via `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` metrics so analysts can compare chance volume, chance quality, and execution between both sides.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_match_possession_passing_clinical_match` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_shot_conversion_peak`; this signal is intentionally distinct because it is team-triggered and keyed to strict goals-vs-on-target efficiency (`>= 3` goals, `<= 5` shots on target) rather than match-total xG divergence or player-level exact shot counts.
