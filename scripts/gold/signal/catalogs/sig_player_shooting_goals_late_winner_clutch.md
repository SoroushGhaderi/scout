# sig_player_shooting_goals_late_winner_clutch

## Purpose

Detects player-level clutch finishing where a player scores the decisive match-winning non-own goal in 90+ time, with explicit score-state evidence and bilateral match context.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Goal event is a non-own goal (`is_goal = 1`, `is_own_goal = 0`) by a valid player/team in a finished match.
  - Goal effective minute (`goal_time + goal_overload_time`) is at least `90`.
  - Goal creates a lead for the scorer's side and the side wins the match.
  - No later opponent goal reaches parity or lead, so the late goal remains the decisive winner.
- Match/player grain:
  - Events are grouped at `match_id + team_id + player_id` to emit one row per triggered player per match.
  - First decisive late-winner timing and first before/after score state are preserved.
- Match-context enrichment:
  - Player finishing context comes from `silver.player_match_stat`.
  - Bilateral team/opponent context comes from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) and `silver.match`.
- Similarity note:
  - Closest active signals are `sig_player_shooting_goals_clutch_equalizer` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_winning_impact`; this signal is distinct because it requires both 90+ timing and decisive winner persistence after the goal.
