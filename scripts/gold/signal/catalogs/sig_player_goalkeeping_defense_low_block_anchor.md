# sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_low_block_anchor

## Purpose

Flags defenders who anchor deep defensive phases by combining high clearance volume (`>= 8`) with clean
individual discipline (`0` fouls) while their team plays under low-possession stress (`< 35%`).

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id = 1` (defender gate)
  - `triggered_player_clearances >= 8`
  - `triggered_player_fouls_committed = 0`
  - `triggered_team_possession_pct < 35.0`
  - `is_goalkeeper = 0`
  - `match_finished = 1`
- Defender scope is resolved from `silver.match_personnel` with starter-priority role resolution, then joined to
  `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Bilateral team context is sourced from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) using symmetric
  `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` defensive/control fields with explicit deltas.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_clearance_machine`: both are clearance-led defender signals, but this signal
    is stricter on discipline (`0` fouls) and contextualizes low-block pressure via possession `< 35%`.
  - `sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_no_fouls_defending`: both require zero fouls, but this signal is explicitly
    clearance-volume + low-possession anchored rather than tackle/duel-volume anchored.
  - `sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_passive_defender`: both use low-possession context, but passive-defender
    captures zero proactive actions while this signal captures high proactive clearance output.
