# sig_match_possession_passing_dribble_fest

## Purpose

Triggers matches with very high combined successful dribble volume, identifying open 1v1-heavy games where both sides repeatedly beat defenders off the dribble.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `match_total_successful_dribbles > 25` at full match (`period = 'All'`).
- Emits one row per side (`triggered_side in {'home','away'}`) so match-level dribble intensity can be consumed in a team-oriented shape.
- Adds bilateral dribble share and success context, plus passing quality, possession, box touches, shot volume, and xG to distinguish productive dribble-fests from chaotic low-yield games.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_possession_passing_dribble_fest.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_dribble_fest.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_possession_passing_dribble_fest`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_dribble_fest.py
```
