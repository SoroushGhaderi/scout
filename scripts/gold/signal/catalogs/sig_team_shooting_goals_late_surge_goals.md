# sig_team_shooting_goals_late_surge_goals

## Purpose

Detect team-level late-match scoring bursts where a side scores at least two non-own goals after the 80th minute.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: team records at least two non-own-goal events with `goal_effective_minute > 80`.
- Effective-minute timing uses `goal_time + goal_overload_time` (fallback `minute + minute_added`) so stoppage-time goals are ordered consistently.
- Triggered rows are side-oriented (`triggered_side`) and preserve bilateral context (`triggered_team_*` vs `opponent_*`) for match interpretation.
- Late-phase timing diagnostics include the first and second qualifying goal timestamps plus the gap between them (`minutes_between_first_two_goals_after_80`).
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_early_blitz` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_late_winner_clutch`; this signal intentionally coexists because it is team-triggered and focuses on multi-goal late surges regardless of whether a single goal is decisive.
