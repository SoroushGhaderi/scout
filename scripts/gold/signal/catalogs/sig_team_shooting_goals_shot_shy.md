# sig_team_shooting_goals_shot_shy

## Purpose

Detect team-level half-game attacking droughts where a side fails to take a single shot in at least one half.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `triggered_team_shots_first_half = 0` OR `triggered_team_shots_second_half = 0`.
- Half splits are computed from `silver.period_stat` using `period IN ('FirstHalf', 'SecondHalf')`.
- Trigger evaluation is restricted to finished matches only.
- The signal emits one row per `match_id` + `triggered_side`; `triggered_half_without_shot` is `FirstHalf`, `SecondHalf`, or `BothHalves`.
- Full-match bilateral context (`period = 'All'`) is preserved for scoreline, shot quality, chance volume, and control interpretation.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_no_shots_allowed` and `sig_team_shooting_goals_blank_range`; this signal is distinct because it is half-level own-shot suppression (volume drought), not opponent-on-target suppression or high-xG finishing failure.
