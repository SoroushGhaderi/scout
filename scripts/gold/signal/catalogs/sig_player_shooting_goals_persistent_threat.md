# sig_player_shooting_goals_persistent_threat

## Purpose

Flags players who sustain shooting presence across the full match by producing at least one shot in every 15-minute segment.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Match must be finished (`match_finished = 1`).
  - Triggered player must record `>= 1` shot in each segment: `00-15`, `16-30`, `31-45+`, `46-60`, `61-75`, `76-90+`.
- Segmentation logic:
  - Segment assignment is derived from shot event timing using effective minute (`minute + minute_added`, with goal-time fallbacks where needed).
  - Stoppage-time events are retained in the boundary segments (`31-45+`, `76-90+`) to preserve continuity and avoid losing late-phase threat.
- Match-context enrichment:
  - Player finishing context is sourced from `silver.player_match_stat`.
  - Bilateral team and opponent context is sourced from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) and `silver.match`.
- Similarity gate note:
  - Closest active shooting-goals signals are `sig_player_shooting_goals_shot_volume_monster` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_shot_magnet`.
  - Coexistence rationale: this signal is cadence/coverage-first (segment persistence), while those signals are absolute volume and share-concentration focused.
