# sig_player_possession_passing_redundant_possession

## Purpose

Triggers when a player has high passing volume but no final-third progression, identifying redundant circulation profiles that keep possession without advancing attacking territory.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_total_passes >= 80`
  - `triggered_player_passes_final_third = 0`
- Current player schema does not expose directional backward/sideways pass tags per match row, so the signal uses:
  - `triggered_player_non_final_third_passes_proxy = max(total_passes - passes_final_third, 0)`
  - `triggered_player_non_final_third_pass_share_pct = proxy / total_passes * 100`
- Triggered player role context is preserved from `silver.match_personnel` via `triggered_player_position_id`, `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id`, and a derived `triggered_player_role_group`.
- Signal includes bilateral team passing, own-half, opposition-half, and possession context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) so analysts can distinguish individual redundancy from team-level tactical design.
- Output stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player traceability.
