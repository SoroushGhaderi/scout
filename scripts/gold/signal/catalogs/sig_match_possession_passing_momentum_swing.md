# sig_match_possession_passing_momentum_swing

## Purpose

Triggers when a team flips from dominant first-half possession (>=70%) to second-half inferiority (<=30%), while the opponent flips from <=30% to >=70%.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: triggered side must be >=70% possession in FirstHalf and <=30% in SecondHalf, while opponent must be <=30% then >=70%.
- Built from half-level pivots and enriched with bilateral pass-volume, pass-accuracy, territorial progression, and xG-half splits.
- Designed to isolate extreme bilateral control reversals (momentum swings), not just normal second-half possession decline.

## Technical Assets

- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_momentum_swing.py`

| `home_team_id` | Home team numeric ID | Football developer: anchors joins across match, team, and downstream feature tables — stable match/team reference field |
| `home_team_name` | Home team display name | Football developer: anchors joins across match, team, and downstream feature tables — stable match/team reference field |
| `away_team_id` | Away team numeric ID | Football developer: anchors joins across match, team, and downstream feature tables — stable match/team reference field |
| `away_team_name` | Away team display name | Football developer: anchors joins across match, team, and downstream feature tables — stable match/team reference field |
| `home_score` | Full-time goals scored by home team | Football developer: anchors joins across match, team, and downstream feature tables / outcome context |
| `away_score` | Full-time goals scored by away team | Football developer: anchors joins across match, team, and downstream feature tables / outcome context |
| `triggered_side` | Whether the triggered team was `'home'` or `'away'` | Football developer: this is the direct trigger metric used to classify the tactical pattern — row orientation label |
| `triggered_team_id` | Numeric ID of the team that experienced the possession momentum swing | Football developer: this is the direct trigger metric used to classify the tactical pattern — core trigger field or direct signal context |
| `triggered_team_name` | Display name of the triggered team | Football developer: this is the direct trigger metric used to classify the tactical pattern — core trigger field or direct signal context |
| `opponent_team_id` | Numeric ID of the opposing team | Football developer: provides side/opponent orientation so tactical readings are not misattributed — opponent or orientation field for bilateral interpretation |
| `opponent_team_name` | Display name of the opposing team | Football developer: provides side/opponent orientation so tactical readings are not misattributed — opponent or orientation field for bilateral interpretation |
| `possession_momentum_swing_pp` | Percentage-point possession change for the triggered team: 2H − 1H (typically <= -40 under the 70/30 -> 30/70 trigger) | Football developer: **Core signal value** |
| `triggered_team_possession_first_half_pct` | Triggered team's ball possession % in the first half | Football developer: this is the direct trigger metric used to classify the tactical pattern — baseline possession |
| `triggered_team_possession_second_half_pct` | Triggered team's ball possession % in the second half | Football developer: this is the direct trigger metric used to classify the tactical pattern — reversal endpoint |
| `opponent_possession_first_half_pct` | Opponent's ball possession % in the first half | Football developer: this is the direct trigger metric used to classify the tactical pattern (symmetric pair) |
| `opponent_possession_second_half_pct` | Opponent's ball possession % in the second half | Football developer: this is the direct trigger metric used to classify the tactical pattern (symmetric pair) |
| `possession_swing_delta` | Net possession dominance swing: (2H gap) − (1H gap) between the two teams | Football developer: adds diagnostic football context to explain why the trigger fired — bilateral shift magnitude |

| `triggered_team_pass_attempts_second_half` | Total pass attempts by triggered team in the second half | Football developer: adds diagnostic football context to explain why the trigger fired — volume collapse detector |
| `opponent_pass_attempts_first_half` | Opponent's total pass attempts in the first half | Football developer: adds diagnostic football context to explain why the trigger fired (symmetric pair) |
| `opponent_pass_attempts_second_half` | Opponent's total pass attempts in the second half | Football developer: adds diagnostic football context to explain why the trigger fired (symmetric pair) |
| `triggered_team_pass_accuracy_first_half_pct` | Triggered team's pass accuracy % in the first half | Football developer: adds diagnostic football context to explain why the trigger fired — quality of possession, 1H baseline |
| `triggered_team_pass_accuracy_second_half_pct` | Triggered team's pass accuracy % in the second half | Football developer: adds diagnostic football context to explain why the trigger fired — did accuracy also decline? |
| `opponent_pass_accuracy_first_half_pct` | Opponent's pass accuracy % in the first half | Football developer: adds diagnostic football context to explain why the trigger fired (symmetric pair) |
| `opponent_pass_accuracy_second_half_pct` | Opponent's pass accuracy % in the second half | Football developer: adds diagnostic football context to explain why the trigger fired (symmetric pair) |
| `triggered_team_pass_accuracy_delta_pct` | Change in pass accuracy % from 1H → 2H for triggered team | Football developer: adds diagnostic football context to explain why the trigger fired — distinguishes intentional low-block from forced error |
| `opponent_pass_accuracy_delta_pct` | Change in pass accuracy % from 1H → 2H for opponent | Football developer: adds diagnostic football context to explain why the trigger fired (symmetric pair) |
| `triggered_team_opposition_half_passes_first_half` | Triggered team passes completed in the opponent's half, 1H | Football developer: adds diagnostic football context to explain why the trigger fired — territorial progression, 1H |
| `triggered_team_opposition_half_passes_second_half` | Triggered team passes completed in the opponent's half, 2H | Football developer: adds diagnostic football context to explain why the trigger fired — did they retreat spatially? |
