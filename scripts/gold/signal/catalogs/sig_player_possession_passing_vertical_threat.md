# sig_player_possession_passing_vertical_threat

## Purpose

Triggers when more than 50% of a player's successful passes are directed forward, identifying players whose completed passing profile consistently creates vertical threat.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_forward_successful_pass_share_pct > 50`
- Because current player schema does not provide direct forward-pass direction counts, the signal uses:
  - `triggered_player_forward_successful_passes_proxy = min(max(passes_final_third, 0), accurate_passes)`
  - `triggered_player_forward_successful_pass_share_pct = proxy / accurate_passes * 100`
- Trigger uses player-level full-match totals from `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Signal includes bilateral team/opponent passing, possession, and opposition-half pass context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to distinguish individual verticality from team-wide territorial dominance.
- Output explicitly stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.

## Technical Assets

- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_vertical_threat.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_possession_passing_vertical_threat`
