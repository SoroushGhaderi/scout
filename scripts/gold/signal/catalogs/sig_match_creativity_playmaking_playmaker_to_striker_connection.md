# sig_match_creativity_playmaking_playmaker_to_striker_connection

## Purpose

Detect match-level creator-finisher partnerships where elite key-pass volume by one player aligns
with repeated direct goal-link connection to a specific teammate.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Requested trigger intent:
  - one player provides `>= 5` key passes to the same teammate.
- Source limitation and proxy contract:
  - receiver-level key-pass destinations are not available in current Silver player stats,
  - so the signal uses a deterministic proxy:
    - creator key-pass volume from `silver.player_match_stat.chances_created` (`>= 5`), plus
    - creator -> finisher connection from `silver.shot` goal assist links
      (`assist_player_id -> player_id`, with at least one linked goal).
- Match scope:
  - `match_finished = 1`, `period = 'All'`, `match_id > 0`.
- Top connection per team is selected deterministically by:
  - creator key passes desc,
  - assisted goals to same finisher desc,
  - creator expected assists desc,
  - creator and finisher IDs as stable tie-breakers.
- Output emits two side-oriented rows (`home`, `away`) for canonical `match_team` grain.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_playmaker_showdown` is the closest sibling on `>= 5` key-pass creators, but it does not model creator->finisher linkage.
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_assist_provider_battle` tracks multi-player assist concentration (`2+ assists`) rather than same-pair connection shape.
  - `sig_player_creativity_playmaking_chance_machine` models player creation via shot-assist traces at player grain, not bilateral match-team connection output.
