# sig_match_shooting_goals_high_volume_low_target

## Purpose

Identify chaotic, low-precision matches where total shooting volume is very high but collective on-target execution is extremely poor, then expose side-oriented context for shot quality, finishing waste, and control diagnostics.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `(coalesce(total_shots_home, 0) + coalesce(total_shots_away, 0)) >= 40` and `(coalesce(shots_on_target_home, 0) + coalesce(shots_on_target_away, 0)) < 5` at `period = 'All'` in finished matches.
- Match-level trigger emits two rows (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain for downstream feature joins.
- Enrichment keeps bilateral explainability with shot share, shot-accuracy, xG-per-shot, conversion, big-chance waste, box touches, possession, and pass quality.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_match_shooting_goals_basketball_match` and `sig_match_shooting_goals_goalless_siege`; this signal is distinct because it is explicitly a *joint inefficiency* trigger (very high combined shot volume with very low combined shots on target), rather than bilateral high-volume tempo or goalless-only siege conditions.
