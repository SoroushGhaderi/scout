# sig_match_shooting_goals_own_goal_drama

## Purpose

Detect finished matches with at least one own goal and expose side-oriented scoring, finishing, and control context so downstream consumers can analyze own-goal dependence and bilateral match dynamics.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `match_total_own_goals >= 1`, derived from `silver.shot` events where `is_goal = 1`, `is_own_goal = 1`, and `is_home_goal` is available.
- Emits two rows per triggered match (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain.
- Own-goal attribution keeps both beneficiary and conceding views: a home-beneficiary own goal implies an away side own-goal concession, and vice versa.
- Enrichment includes own-goal share/dependence metrics, non-own-goal decomposition, shot quality/volume (`shots_on_target`, `xg`), and control context (`possession_pct`, `pass_accuracy_pct`).
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_match_shooting_goals_penalty_decided_match` and `sig_team_shooting_goals_no_striker_needed`; this signal is distinct because it is triggered specifically by own-goal events at match scope, not by penalty-only scorelines or team role-based non-own-goal composition.
