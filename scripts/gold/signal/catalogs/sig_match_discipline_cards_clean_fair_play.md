# sig_match_discipline_cards_clean_fair_play

## Purpose

Flags low-contact matches with no cards at all, isolating clean fair-play profiles where both teams keep foul volume controlled and avoid disciplinary sanctions.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `fouls_home + fouls_away <= 12`
  - `(yellow_cards_home + red_cards_home + yellow_cards_away + red_cards_away) = 0`
- Trigger is match-level and emitted as two side-oriented rows (`home` and `away`) so team-centric downstream workflows can consume symmetric context.
- Output preserves bilateral foul split, card-per-foul rates, defensive action context, passing accuracy, and possession balance.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_discipline_cards_clean_fair_play.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_clean_fair_play.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_discipline_cards_clean_fair_play`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_clean_fair_play.py
```
