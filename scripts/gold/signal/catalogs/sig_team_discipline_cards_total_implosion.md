# sig_team_discipline_cards_total_implosion

## Purpose

Flags team-match rows where dismissal concentration reaches two or more red cards in one half, surfacing acute discipline collapse timing rather than only full-match totals.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `max(triggered_team_red_cards_first_half, triggered_team_red_cards_second_half) >= 2`
- Trigger-half resolution:
  - `triggered_half = first_half` when first-half red cards are greater than or equal to second-half red cards.
  - `triggered_half = second_half` otherwise.
- Trigger is evaluated symmetrically for home and away teams from `silver.period_stat` half splits, then enriched with bilateral full-match context from `silver.period_stat` at `period = 'All'`.

## Technical Assets

- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_discipline_cards_total_implosion.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_discipline_cards_total_implosion`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_discipline_cards_total_implosion.py
