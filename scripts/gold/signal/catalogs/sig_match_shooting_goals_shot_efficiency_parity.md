# sig_match_shooting_goals_shot_efficiency_parity

## Purpose

Detect finished matches where both teams end with identical shots on target and identical goals, then provide bilateral context to explain whether parity came from mirrored chance quality or offsetting tactical paths.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `coalesce(shots_on_target_home, 0) = coalesce(shots_on_target_away, 0)` and `coalesce(home_score, 0) = coalesce(away_score, 0)` at `period = 'All'`.
- Emits two rows per triggered match (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) to keep canonical `match_team` grain for downstream joins.
- Enrichment focuses on parity diagnostics: goals per shot on target, total-shot and xG asymmetry, goals-minus-xG balance, big-chance usage, box-touch pressure, and control/circulation context.
- Similarity gate note: nearest active signals are `sig_match_shooting_goals_boring_stalemate` and `sig_match_shooting_goals_basketball_match`; this signal is distinct because it requires dual equality on *both* outcome (`goals`) and execution proxy (`shots on target`) regardless of event volume.
