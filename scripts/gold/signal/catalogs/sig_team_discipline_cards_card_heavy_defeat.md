# sig_team_discipline_cards_card_heavy_defeat

## Purpose

Flags team-match performances where a side receives a red card and still loses by 3+ goals, isolating high-severity discipline-linked collapses.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Team loses by at least three goals.
  - Team receives at least one red card in the same match.
- Earliest triggered-side red-card event is used as a timing anchor for score-state and post-dismissal goal swing.
- Output preserves bilateral discipline, foul load, defensive action profile, and possession context to separate pure scoreline noise from structural collapse patterns.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_discipline_cards_card_heavy_defeat.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_discipline_cards_card_heavy_defeat.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_discipline_cards_card_heavy_defeat`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_discipline_cards_card_heavy_defeat.py
```
