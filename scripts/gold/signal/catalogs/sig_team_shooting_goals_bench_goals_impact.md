# sig_team_shooting_goals_bench_goals_impact

## Purpose

Detect team scoring performances where the bench contributes at least two non-own goals, signaling high substitute finishing impact within the match.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_substitute_non_own_goals >= 2`
- Substitute scorers are derived from `silver.match_personnel` (`role = 'substitute'`, `substitution_time > 0`) joined to non-own goals in `silver.shot` (`is_goal = 1`, `is_own_goal = 0`).
- Goal events are counted only when the goal effective minute (`goal_time + goal_overload_time`) is at or after the recorded substitution time.
- Trigger is evaluated separately for home and away teams in finished matches (`silver.match.match_finished = 1`).
- Bilateral output includes substitute-goal volume, substitute-scorer spread, timing markers, and shooting/possession context as `triggered_team_*` vs `opponent_*` metrics.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_player_shooting_goals_super_sub_goal` and `sig_team_shooting_goals_shared_scoring`; this signal is distinct because it is team-level and bench-contribution driven (`>= 2` substitute non-own goals), rather than player-level fast-impact scoring or broad scorer-diversity triggers.
