# sig_team_possession_passing_pass_marathon

## Purpose

Triggers when a team reaches extreme full-match passing volume (`>= 800` completed passes), signaling sustained circulation control and long-possession game states.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `triggered_team_total_passes >= 800` using `silver.period_stat` rows where `period = 'All'`.
- Signal is side-specific (`home` / `away`) and emits one row per triggered side, so both teams can independently trigger in the same match.
- Enrichment preserves bilateral context for pass quality, possession split, territorial progression, and chance creation quality.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_pass_marathon.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_pass_marathon.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_pass_marathon`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_pass_marathon.py
```
