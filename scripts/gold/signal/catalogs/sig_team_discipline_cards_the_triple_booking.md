# sig_team_discipline_cards_the_triple_booking

## Purpose

Flags teams hit by a compact wave of cautions across multiple players, isolating sudden discipline flashpoints rather than general full-match card volume.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_distinct_yellow_carded_players_in_window >= 3`
  - the rolling window uses `card_minute <= window_start_minute + 5`
- Yellow-card events are sourced from `silver.card` where `card_type` or `description` includes yellow-card or booked terminology.
- The trigger is evaluated independently for home and away teams, then emits one row per triggered match-team.
- If a team has multiple qualifying windows, the earliest window is selected using the earliest start minute, then earliest third distinct yellow-card minute.
- Output preserves bilateral context: opponent maximum 5-minute booking window, full-match card and foul load, physical defensive actions, and possession balance.
