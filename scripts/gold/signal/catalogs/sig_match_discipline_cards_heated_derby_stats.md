# sig_match_discipline_cards_heated_derby_stats

## Purpose

Flags matches with jointly high sanction volume and contact pressure, capturing derby-like game states where discipline and whistle intensity rise together.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `(yellow_cards_home + yellow_cards_away + red_cards_home + red_cards_away) >= 5`
  - `(fouls_home + fouls_away) >= 30`
  - both from `silver.period_stat` at `period = 'All'`.
- Trigger is match-level and emitted as two side-oriented rows (`home` and `away`) for stable team-grain downstream consumption.
- Output combines card composition, foul share, sanctions-per-foul conversion, defensive workload, and possession context for bilateral interpretation.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_discipline_cards_heated_derby_stats.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_heated_derby_stats.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_discipline_cards_heated_derby_stats`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_heated_derby_stats.py
```
