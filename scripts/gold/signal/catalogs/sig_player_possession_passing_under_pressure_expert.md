# sig_player_possession_passing_under_pressure_expert

## Purpose

Flags players who keep elite pass accuracy under sustained opponent pressure, isolating high-composure passing performances in difficult game states.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_pass_accuracy_pct > 90`
- High defensive pressure is operationalized as opponent press-action intensity against the triggered player's team:
  - `opponent_press_actions >= 35`
  - `opponent_press_actions_per_100_triggered_passes >= 10.0`
- Press actions are computed as:
  - `interceptions + tackles_won + fouls`
- A pass-volume reliability guard is applied:
  - `triggered_player_total_passes >= 30`
- Team and opponent passing/territory/pressure metrics are included symmetrically (`triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*`) to separate true pressure resistance from low-tempo or low-load contexts.
