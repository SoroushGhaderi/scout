# sig_team_possession_passing_failed_penetration

## Purpose

Detects matches where a team records high opponent-box touch volume without converting that territory into inside-box shot generation.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `touches_opp_box >= 30` with `shots_inside_box < 10` (for home or away).
- Signal name source: `-- === sig_team_possession_passing_failed_penetration ===`
- Trigger condition source: `-- Detects matches where a team achieves >= 30 touches in the opponent penalty box`

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_failed_penetration.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_failed_penetration.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_failed_penetration`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_failed_penetration.py
```
