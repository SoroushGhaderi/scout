# sig_match_possession_passing_wing_play_extravaganza

## Purpose

Triggers when both teams combine for extreme crossing volume, surfacing wing-dominant match states where chance creation funnels through wide delivery.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `match_total_cross_attempts > 60` from full-match period stats.
- Emits one row per side (`triggered_side` = `home` and `away`) so the same match-level trigger can be read from both team orientations.
- Uses bilateral crossing volume and crossing efficiency to reveal who drove the wing-heavy profile.
- Adds pass volume, possession, shot output, and xG context to separate productive wing play from sterile crossing accumulation.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_possession_passing_wing_play_extravaganza.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_wing_play_extravaganza.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_possession_passing_wing_play_extravaganza`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_wing_play_extravaganza.py
```
