# sig_player_possession_passing_one_touch_specialist

## Purpose

Triggers when a player records high passing volume with very low touches-per-pass ratio, surfacing quick-release circulation specialists.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_total_passes >= 50`
  - `triggered_player_touches_per_pass < 1.2`
- Touches-per-pass is computed as `triggered_player_total_touches / triggered_player_total_passes` and evaluated only where the pass-volume gate is met.
- Uses player-level full-match totals from `silver.player_match_stat` and bilateral team/opponent passing-possession context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`).
- Persists both player identity and team identity fields for contract-compliant downstream joins.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_player_possession_passing_one_touch_specialist.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_one_touch_specialist.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_possession_passing_one_touch_specialist`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_one_touch_specialist.py
```
