# sig_match_shooting_goals_clean_sheet_broken_late

## Purpose

Detect finished matches where the first non-own goal arrives only after the 88th minute and breaks a 0-0 state, then expose side-oriented finishing and control context.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: first goal event in the match satisfies `first_goal_effective_minute >= 89`, `home_score_before_first_goal = 0`, and `away_score_before_first_goal = 0`.
- Goal timing uses `goal_effective_minute = coalesce(goal_time, minute, 0) + coalesce(goal_overload_time, minute_added, 0)`.
- Goal events come from `silver.shot` where `is_goal = 1` and `is_own_goal = 0`.
- First-goal selection is deterministic using `row_number()` ordered by `(goal_effective_minute, goal_minute, goal_added_time, shot_id)`.
- Triggered matches emit two rows (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) for canonical `match_team` grain.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_match_shooting_goals_early_goal_late_goal`, `sig_match_shooting_goals_high_pressure_finish`, and `sig_player_shooting_goals_late_winner_clutch`; this signal is distinct because it is explicitly first-goal timing + pre-goal score-state driven.
