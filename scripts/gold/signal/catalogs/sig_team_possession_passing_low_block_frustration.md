# sig_team_possession_passing_low_block_frustration

## Purpose

Triggers when a team records extreme cross volume in one match, indicating wide-overload behaviour caused by blocked central access.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `cross_attempts > 40` on full-match stats (`period = 'All'`) for home or away.
- This flags low-block frustration patterns where central progression is denied and attacks are repeatedly rerouted wide.
- Enrichment fields validate whether crossing pressure converted into threat and whether opponent defensive block behaviours were present.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_low_block_frustration.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_low_block_frustration.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_low_block_frustration`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_low_block_frustration.py
```
