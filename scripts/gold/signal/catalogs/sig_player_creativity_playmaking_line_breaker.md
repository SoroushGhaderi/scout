# sig_player_creativity_playmaking_line_breaker

## Purpose

Detect player-level line-breaking playmaking performances using directional progression proxies when direct progressive-pass counts are unavailable in current source stats.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_passes_final_third_directional_proxy >= 10`
  - OR `triggered_team_long_ball_attempts_directional_proxy >= 10`
- Directional proxy sources:
  - player proxy: `silver.player_match_stat.passes_final_third`
  - team proxy: `silver.period_stat.long_ball_attempts_{home|away}` with `period = 'All'`
- Trigger provenance is explicit per row through:
  - `triggered_player_directional_proxy_source`
  - `triggered_player_directional_proxy_value`
  - `triggered_player_directional_proxy_above_threshold`
- Finished-match scope and valid side mapping are enforced:
  - `silver.match.match_finished = 1`
  - `match_id > 0`
  - player team must map to home/away side.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_player_possession_passing_final_third_engine`: closest metric overlap on `passes_final_third`, but it uses a much stricter threshold (`>= 20`) and sits in possession taxonomy.
  - `sig_player_creativity_playmaking_maestro_output`: same creativity/playmaking family, but trigger is key-pass volume (`chances_created >= 5`) rather than directional progression proxy.
  - `sig_player_creativity_playmaking_expected_wizard`: same family, but trigger is xA under-assist profile, not directional progression volume.
  - Coexistence rationale: this signal adds a lower-threshold directional proxy specifically for creativity/playmaking classification, including a documented team-directness fallback proxy.
