# sig_match_possession_passing_high_turnover_affair

## Purpose

Triggers for matches with very high combined dispossession/turnover volume, surfacing chaotic possession games where both sides repeatedly lose the ball.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `match_total_turnovers >= 60` from full-match (`period = 'All'`) team stats.
- Turnover proxy definition: `failed_passes + failed_dribbles`, where `failed_passes = max(pass_attempts - accurate_passes, 0)` and `failed_dribbles = max(dribble_attempts - successful_dribbles, 0)`.
- Emits one row per side (`triggered_side` = `home` and `away`) so team-centric consumers can interpret the same high-turnover profile from each tactical orientation.
- Enriches the trigger with bilateral turnover decomposition, passing quality, dribble security, possession share, shot context, and xG context.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_possession_passing_high_turnover_affair.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_high_turnover_affair.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_possession_passing_high_turnover_affair`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_high_turnover_affair.py
```
