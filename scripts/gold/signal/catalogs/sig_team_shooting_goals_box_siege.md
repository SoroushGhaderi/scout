# sig_team_shooting_goals_box_siege

## Purpose

Detect team-level penalty-area shot sieges where one side generates extreme inside-box volume (`>= 20`) in a single finished match.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_shots_inside_box >= 20`
- Inside-box scope uses shot-location events where the attempt origin is inside the penalty area.
- Trigger evaluation is full-match only (`period = 'All'`) and finished matches only.
- Signal output remains bilateral (`triggered_team_*` vs `opponent_*`) to separate true box pressure dominance from game-state inflation.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_shooting_gallery` and `sig_team_shooting_goals_long_range_barrage`; this signal coexists because it is zone-specific (inside-box volume) rather than total-shot volume or outside-box reliance.
