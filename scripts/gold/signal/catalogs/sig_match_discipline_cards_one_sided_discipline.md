# sig_match_discipline_cards_one_sided_discipline

## Purpose

Flags matches with extreme disciplinary asymmetry, where one side accumulates at least five cards and the other side remains card-free.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_total_cards >= 5`
  - `opponent_total_cards = 0`
- Total cards are computed as `yellow_cards + red_cards` from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`).
- Trigger orientation (`triggered_side`) is selected dynamically as the side meeting the `>= 5` condition.
- Output preserves bilateral card composition, fouls, defensive actions, passing quality, and possession context to explain whether the sanction asymmetry tracked tactical imbalance or match-state volatility.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_discipline_cards_one_sided_discipline.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_one_sided_discipline.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_discipline_cards_one_sided_discipline`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_one_sided_discipline.py
```
