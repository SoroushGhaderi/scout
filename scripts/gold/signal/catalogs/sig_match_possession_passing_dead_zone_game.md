# sig_match_possession_passing_dead_zone_game

## Purpose

Triggers matches where both teams fail to generate any opposition-box touches, surfacing sterile, low-penetration game states that align with a tactical dead-zone profile.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `touches_opp_box_home = 0` and `touches_opp_box_away = 0` at full-match period stats.
- Because no dedicated 6-yard touch metric exists in `silver.period_stat`, this signal uses opposition-box touches as the closest available proxy for the requested dead-zone condition.
- Emits one row per side (`home` and `away`) so downstream team pipelines can consume a side-oriented record for the same match-level trigger.
- Enriches the trigger with pass volume, pass accuracy, possession share, territorial pass context, and xG context.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_possession_passing_dead_zone_game.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_dead_zone_game.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_possession_passing_dead_zone_game`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_dead_zone_game.py
```
