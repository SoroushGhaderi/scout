# sig_match_possession_passing_clinical_match

## Purpose

Flags extreme finishing matches where total scoring is high despite low underlying xG, then emits side-oriented rows for symmetric tactical diagnosis.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `(home_score + away_score) >= 5` and `(expected_goals_home + expected_goals_away) <= 2.5` at `period='All'`.
- Emits one row per side (`triggered_side in {'home','away'}`) so model features and diagnostics stay team-oriented while preserving identical match context.
- Quantifies clinical overperformance at match and side levels using goals-minus-xG deltas, while retaining passing and territorial context.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_possession_passing_clinical_match.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_clinical_match.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_possession_passing_clinical_match`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_clinical_match.py
```
