# sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_cb_playmaker_defense

## Purpose

Flag center-back performances that combine high anticipation output and high distribution load, capturing defenders who both disrupt attacks and dictate buildup.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_interceptions >= 5`
  - `triggered_player_accurate_passes >= 60`
  - `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id = 1` (defender scope)
  - `triggered_player_position_id IN (3, 4)` (center-back proxy)
  - `is_goalkeeper = 0`
  - `match_finished = 1`
- Position scope is resolved from `silver.match_personnel` with starter-priority role resolution per `(match_id, person_id)`.
- Player defensive and passing diagnostics are sourced from `silver.player_match_stat`, including interceptions, tackles, clearances, duels, pass quality, and pass-territory proxy metrics.
- Bilateral team context is sourced from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) with symmetric `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` context plus explicit deltas.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_interception_king`: close defensive anticipation overlap, but that trigger is single-metric interceptions (`>= 7`) and does not require heavy passing output.
  - `sig_player_possession_passing_deep_playmaker`: close center-back passing overlap, but that signal belongs to possession/passing and triggers only on accurate passes (`>= 80`) without defensive interception criteria.
  - `sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_defensive_double_double`: close dual-defensive threshold framing, but that signal uses tackles+interceptions and does not enforce center-back passing volume.
