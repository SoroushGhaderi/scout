# sig_team_possession_passing_possession_efficiency

## Purpose

Detect teams that score at least 3 goals while holding 40% possession or less, highlighting extreme scoreline efficiency without territorial control.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `team goals >= 3` with `triggered_team_possession_pct <= 40` in full-match period stats (`period = 'All'`).
- Captures matches where low-control teams are highly clinical, usually through transition attacks, direct progression, or set-piece leverage.
- Bilateral enrichment compares finishing, shot quality, passing quality, and territorial progression versus the opponent.

## Technical Assets

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_possession_efficiency.py
```
