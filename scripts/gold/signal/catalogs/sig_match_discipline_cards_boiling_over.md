# sig_match_discipline_cards_boiling_over

## Purpose

Flags matches where discipline breaks down late, with at least four cards issued after minute 80.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Combined yellow/red card events with `card_minute > 80` is `>= 4`.
  - Card events are sourced from `silver.card` using yellow/red keywords in `card_type`/`description`.
- Trigger is match-level and emitted as two side-oriented rows (`home` and `away`) for stable `match_team` consumption.
- Output keeps late-window bilateral split, late-window share, total-match discipline context, foul conversion context, and defensive/possession context for tactical interpretation.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_discipline_cards_boiling_over.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_boiling_over.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_discipline_cards_boiling_over`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_boiling_over.py
```
