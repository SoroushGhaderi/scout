# sig_player_possession_passing_keeper_distributor

## Purpose

Triggers when a goalkeeper records high short-distribution completion volume (`>= 25`) in a finished match, surfacing keeper-led build-up control profiles.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `triggered_player_accurate_short_passes_proxy >= 25`.
- Because `silver.player_match_stat` does not expose direct short-pass completion fields, short passes are proxied as:
  - `triggered_player_accurate_short_passes_proxy = max(accurate_passes - accurate_long_balls, 0)`
  - `triggered_player_short_pass_attempts_proxy = max(total_passes - long_ball_attempts, 0)`
- The signal restricts scope to goalkeepers only (`is_goalkeeper = 1`) and enriches each row with symmetric team/opponent pass volume, pass accuracy, own-half pass volume, and possession context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`).
- Output stores both triggered player identity and triggered team identity for contract-compliant player-grain traceability.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_player_possession_passing_keeper_distributor.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_keeper_distributor.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_possession_passing_keeper_distributor`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_keeper_distributor.py
