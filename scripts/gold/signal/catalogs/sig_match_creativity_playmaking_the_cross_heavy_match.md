# sig_match_creativity_playmaking_the_cross_heavy_match

## Purpose

Detect finished matches where both sides collectively sustain very high successful crossing volume,
then preserve bilateral crossing quality and creation context at match-team grain.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `match_combined_successful_crosses > 25`, where
  - `match_combined_successful_crosses = accurate_crosses_home + accurate_crosses_away`.
- Match scope:
  - `match_finished = 1`, `period = 'All'`, `match_id > 0`.
- Crossing metrics source:
  - `silver.period_stat.accurate_crosses_{home|away}` for successful crosses.
  - `silver.period_stat.cross_attempts_{home|away}` for crossing volume and accuracy denominator.
- Creativity context source:
  - Team key passes (`chances_created`) and expected assists are aggregated from
    `silver.player_match_stat` by `match_id + team_id`.
- Output shape:
  - Emits two rows per triggered match (`triggered_side = home|away`) for canonical
    `match_team` grain with symmetric triggered/opponent fields.
- Similarity gate note:
  - Closest active match-level sibling is `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_long_ball_duel`, which is bilateral directness-driven on long-ball completions (`>= 15` each) rather than crossing completions.
  - `sig_team_creativity_playmaking_crossing_clinic` is the closest crossing signal but is team-triggered (`triggered_team_successful_crosses >= 10`) rather than combined match-level crossing load.
  - `sig_team_possession_passing_cross_spam` is attempt-driven in possession family, while this signal is successful-cross completion driven in creativity/playmaking.
