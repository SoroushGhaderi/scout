# sig_player_shooting_goals_clutch_equalizer

## Purpose

Detects player-level clutch scoring moments where a player restores parity late (`> 85`) with a non-own goal, preserving timing evidence plus bilateral team context.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Non-own goal (`is_goal = 1`, `is_own_goal = 0`) from `silver.shot`.
  - Goal occurs after the 85th minute (`goal_time > 85`).
  - Goal is an equalizer (`home_score_after = away_score_after`).
- Match/player grain:
  - Equalizer events are grouped to `match_id + team_id + player_id` to emit one row per triggered player per match.
  - First and last late-equalizer timing features are retained for sequence analysis in rare multi-event matches.
- Match-context enrichment:
  - Player finishing context comes from `silver.player_match_stat` (goals, xG, shot volume, shot accuracy proxy, minutes).
  - Bilateral team/opponent context comes from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) and `silver.match`.
- Similarity note:
  - Closest active signals are `sig_player_shooting_goals_hat_trick_hero` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_long_range_specialist`; this signal is distinct because it is specifically state-change and late-timing driven (equalizing after minute 85), not pure volume/location scoring output.
