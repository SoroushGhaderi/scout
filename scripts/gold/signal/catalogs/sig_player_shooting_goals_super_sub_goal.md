# sig_player_shooting_goals_super_sub_goal

## Purpose

Detects immediate substitute scoring impact by flagging players who score a non-own goal within five minutes of entering.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Substitute player (`silver.match_personnel.role = 'substitute'`) with `substitution_time > 0`.
  - Non-own goal event from `silver.shot` where `is_goal = 1`, `is_own_goal = 0`.
  - Goal effective minute (`goal_time + goal_overload_time`) is within 5 minutes of substitution time.
- One row is emitted per `match_id + triggered_player_id + triggered_team_id`.
- Trigger timing diagnostics preserve first qualifying goal minute, added time, effective minute, and score state before/after that goal.
- Bilateral team/opponent context is sourced from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) with symmetric `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` fields.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signal is `sig_player_shooting_goals_clutch_equalizer`; overlap exists on shot-level goal timing, but this signal is substitution-timing driven rather than late equalizer game-state driven, so they coexist.
