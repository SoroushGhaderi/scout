# sig_team_possession_passing_short_pass_philosophy

## Purpose

Triggers when a team keeps long-ball usage at `<= 5%` of pass attempts, indicating a short-passing philosophy.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `long_ball_attempts / pass_attempts * 100 <= 5` in full-match period stats (`period = 'All'`), evaluated independently for home and away.
- Rows are side-resolved (`triggered_side` is `home` or `away`) and preserve symmetric opponent context.
- Enrichment captures pass quality, territorial pass distribution, possession control, and attacking output generated from this short-passing profile.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_short_pass_philosophy.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_short_pass_philosophy.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_short_pass_philosophy`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_short_pass_philosophy.py
```
