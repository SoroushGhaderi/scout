# sig_match_possession_passing_passing_clinic

## Purpose

Triggers when both sides sustain elite pass completion for the entire game, flagging matches that function as bilateral passing clinics.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: both teams have pass accuracy strictly greater than `88%` in `All`, `FirstHalf`, and `SecondHalf`.
- Emits one row per side (`triggered_side in {'home','away'}`) so downstream consumers can analyze the same match from each team orientation.
- Enriches the trigger with pass volume by half, territorial progression, shot output, and xG context to separate sterile safety from high-quality control.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_possession_passing_passing_clinic.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_passing_clinic.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_possession_passing_passing_clinic`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_passing_clinic.py
```
