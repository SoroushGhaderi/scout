# sig_team_shooting_goals_clinical_finishing_streak

## Purpose

Detect team matches with a perfect on-target finishing streak at meaningful volume (`>= 3` shots on target), where every on-target effort becomes a goal.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_shots_on_target >= 3`
  - `triggered_team_goals = triggered_team_shots_on_target`
- Trigger is evaluated side-by-side for home and away teams in finished matches using full-match stats (`period = 'All'`).
- Bilateral enrichment is preserved with symmetric `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` fields so the conversion streak can be compared against opponent execution, chance quality, and territorial control.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signal is `sig_team_shooting_goals_ruthless_efficiency`; this signal intentionally narrows to exact perfect conversion (`100%` goals per shot on target) with a minimum on-target floor, while the other allows non-perfect conversion (`>= 3` goals from `<= 5` shots on target).
