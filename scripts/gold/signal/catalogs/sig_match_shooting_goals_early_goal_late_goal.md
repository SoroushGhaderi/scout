# sig_match_shooting_goals_early_goal_late_goal

## Purpose

Flag finished matches that feature both an opening-phase breakthrough and an endgame strike, then expose side-oriented scoring-window splits plus shooting/control context.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `match_early_goal_count >= 1` in effective-minute window `[1, 5]`.
  - `match_late_goal_count >= 1` in effective-minute window `[86, +inf)`.
- Goal events come from `silver.shot` where `is_goal = 1` and `is_own_goal = 0`; ordering minute is `goal_time + goal_overload_time` with minute fallbacks.
- Triggered matches emit two rows (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain.
- Window diagnostics capture bilateral early/late split counts plus span from first early goal to last late goal.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_early_blitz`, `sig_team_shooting_goals_late_surge_goals`, and `sig_match_shooting_goals_rapid_fire_exchange`; this signal is distinct because it is a match-level conjunction requiring at least one early-window and one late-window goal in the same match.
