# sig_team_shooting_goals_sustained_barrage

## Purpose

Detect team-level shot barrages where one side compresses high attempt volume into a short 15-minute match window.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: triggered side reaches `>= 10` shots inside a 15-minute effective-minute window.
- Window timing uses effective minute (`goal_time + goal_overload_time`, fallback `minute + minute_added`) so stoppage-time shots remain ordered consistently.
- Trigger search is rolling and side-symmetric: for each team, every shot minute is treated as a potential 15-minute window start.
- If multiple windows satisfy the trigger, the signal keeps the highest-shot window, then earliest start minute as deterministic tie-break.
- Enrichment keeps bilateral context for match-level translation checks: window quality (on-target/xG), full-match shot quality, and control/circulation metrics.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signal is `sig_team_shooting_goals_shooting_gallery`; this signal intentionally coexists because it is tempo-concentration-first (10 shots in 15 minutes) rather than full-match volume-first (25+ shots overall).
