# sig_player_discipline_cards_walking_tightrope

## Purpose

Flags players who are booked early (before minute 20), indicating immediate disciplinary risk that can constrain aggression and duel behavior for the rest of the match.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_first_yellow_card_minute < 20`
- Trigger source:
  - `silver.card` yellow-card events (`card_type` contains "yellow"), grouped by player and match, using earliest yellow minute as the trigger anchor.
- Identity and side logic:
  - Output keeps full player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and team/opponent identity (`triggered_team_*`, `opponent_team_*`) using canonical `triggered_side`.
- Context enrichment:
  - Player context from `silver.player_match_stat` (fouls, duels, tackles, interceptions, minutes).
  - Bilateral team context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) for fouls, cards, duels, tackles, interceptions, and possession.
  - Score-state context at the booking moment via `score_margin_at_first_yellow`.
