# sig_match_creativity_playmaking_set_piece_creative_duel

## Purpose

Detect finished matches where both teams convert set-piece delivery into direct goal creation
(via assisted set-piece goals), isolating bilateral dead-ball creativity duels.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `home_set_piece_assists >= 1`
  - `away_set_piece_assists >= 1`
- Set-piece scope for assisted shots/goals uses `silver.shot.situation IN`
  `('FromCorner', 'FreeKick', 'SetPiece', 'ThrowInSetPiece')`.
- A set-piece assist is counted when:
  - `assist_player_id > 0`
  - `is_goal = 1`
  - `is_own_goal = 0`
- Match scope:
  - `silver.match.match_finished = 1`
  - `match_id > 0`
  - `silver.period_stat.period = 'All'`
- Side orientation:
  - Emits one row for `home` and one for `away` (`match_team` grain symmetry).
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_team_creativity_playmaking_set_piece_threat_volume` is the closest set-piece creativity sibling, but it is unilateral team-triggered on dead-ball chance volume (`>= 8`) rather than bilateral assisted-goal creation.
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_the_creativity_clash` is bilateral match-level creativity, but xA-threshold-driven instead of set-piece-assisted-goal-driven.
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_big_chance_fest` is high-event match-level playmaking volume, while this signal is dead-ball assist realization specific.
