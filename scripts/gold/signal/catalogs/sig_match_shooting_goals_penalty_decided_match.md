# sig_match_shooting_goals_penalty_decided_match

## Purpose

Detect tight finished matches that are decided entirely by penalties (1-0, 0-1, or 1-1 with no non-penalty goals), then emit bilateral team rows for shooting, xG, and control diagnostics.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `match_finished = 1`, scoreline in `{1-0, 0-1, 1-1}`, and `match_total_penalty_goals = match_total_goals` with `match_total_non_penalty_goals = 0`.
- Penalty goals are identified from `silver.shot` goal events where `situation` or `shot_type` contains `"penalty"` (case-insensitive).
- Emits two rows per triggered match (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain.
- Enrichment includes penalty/non-penalty goal decomposition plus bilateral shot quality, conversion, non-penalty xG context, and possession/passing balance.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_match_shooting_goals_high_xg_low_score` and `sig_team_discipline_cards_penalty_prone`; this signal remains distinct because it is explicitly match-scoreline-bound and requires *all* goals to be penalties, rather than general low-scoring inefficiency or team-level penalty-concession volume.
