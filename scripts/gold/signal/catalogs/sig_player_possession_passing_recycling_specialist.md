# sig_player_possession_passing_recycling_specialist

## Purpose

Triggers when a midfielder records elite pass retention from deep circulation zones, identifying defensive-midfield recycling specialists.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_pass_accuracy_pct > 95`
  - `triggered_player_non_final_third_pass_share_pct > 95`
  - `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id = 2` (midfielder role scope)
- Current player schema does not expose direct own-half pass counts/accuracy by player, so this signal uses:
  - `triggered_player_non_final_third_passes_proxy = max(total_passes - passes_final_third, 0)`
  - `triggered_player_non_final_third_pass_share_pct = proxy / total_passes * 100`
- Midfielder role context comes from `silver.match_personnel` and is preserved via both `triggered_player_position_id` and `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id`.
- Signal includes bilateral passing, possession, and team own-half pass context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to separate individual deep recycling from team-wide style.
- Output explicitly stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.
