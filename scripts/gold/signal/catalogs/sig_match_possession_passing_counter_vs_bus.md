# sig_match_possession_passing_counter_vs_bus

## Purpose

Triggers when a match shows an extreme territorial split: one side monopolizes possession (>70%) while the other side still produces frequent counter-attacking threat (>5 proxy events).

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: one side has `ball_possession > 70` and the opposing side has `counter_attacks_proxy > 5`.
- Because `silver.period_stat` has no native counter-attack count, `counter_attacks_proxy` is computed from `silver.shot.situation` text patterns matching `counter|fast`.
- Signal emits two rows per qualifying match (`triggered_side in {'home','away'}`) for bilateral side-oriented analysis.
- Output preserves role identity (`possession_dominant_side`, `counter_attacking_side`) so downstream users can separate controller and transition side explicitly.
- Adds passing quality, shot threat, box touches, clearances, and xG context to distinguish sterile dominance from dangerous transition games.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_possession_passing_counter_vs_bus.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_counter_vs_bus.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_possession_passing_counter_vs_bus`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_counter_vs_bus.py
```
