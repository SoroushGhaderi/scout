# sig_match_shooting_goals_complete_dominance

## Purpose

Detect extreme one-sided chance-quality control where one team generates at least ten times the opponent xG, then emit side-oriented diagnostics for finishing, shot profile, and control context.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_xg > 0`
  - `triggered_team_xg / opponent_xg >= 10.0`, or `opponent_xg = 0`
- Trigger is evaluated on `silver.period_stat` with `period = 'All'` and finished matches only.
- This signal emits only the qualifying side row (`triggered_side`) per match because the trigger is intrinsically side-specific.
- Enrichment keeps bilateral context with xG share, shot-volume/accuracy, conversion, big chances, box touches, possession, and pass-quality differentials.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_shot_on_target_monopoly` and `sig_match_shooting_goals_high_xg_low_score`; this signal is distinct because it is purely xG-ratio based (>= 10x side imbalance) and does not require a specific scoreline or shots-on-target threshold.
