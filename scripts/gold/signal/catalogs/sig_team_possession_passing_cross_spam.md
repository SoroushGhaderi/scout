# sig_team_possession_passing_cross_spam

## Purpose

Detect teams that repeatedly force wide delivery routes through extreme crossing volume, then profile whether this crossing spam produced meaningful territorial and chance-quality outcomes.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Signal name source: `-- Signal: sig_team_possession_passing_cross_spam`
- Trigger condition source: `-- Trigger: Team attempts >= 35 crosses in a single match.`
- Signal emits one row per triggered side (`home` / `away`) and keeps bilateral opponent context to avoid one-sided interpretation.
- Enrichment separates raw spam behavior from execution quality (`cross_accuracy`, `cross_share_of_passes`) and final outcomes (`shots`, `crosses_per_shot`, `xg`).

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_cross_spam.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_cross_spam.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_cross_spam`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_cross_spam.py
```
