# sig_player_possession_passing_deadball_creator

## Purpose

Triggers when a player creates at least 1 big chance from indirect free kicks in a single match, identifying dead-ball creators who consistently produce high-quality opportunities.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_indirect_free_kick_big_chances_created > 0`
- Indirect free-kick creation is modeled from `silver.shot` rows where `situation IN ('FreeKick', 'SetPiece')` and the player is recorded as `assist_player_id`.
- Big chances are proxied at shot level by `expected_goals >= 0.30` because a direct per-shot big-chance flag is not available in `silver.shot`.
- Signal keeps bilateral team/opponent context via `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) and adds set-piece shot context from `silver.shot`.
- Output stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.

## Technical Assets
