# sig_team_discipline_cards_hostile_territory

## Purpose

Flags team-match performances where disciplinary events outnumber on-target shots, capturing aggressive or frustrated matches with limited attacking precision.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_total_cards > triggered_team_shots_on_target`
  - Equivalent threshold form: `triggered_team_cards_minus_shots_on_target >= 1`
- Total cards are computed as yellow plus red cards from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`).
- Trigger is evaluated symmetrically for home and away sides.
- Output preserves bilateral card, shooting, fouling, defensive, and possession context for interpretation.

## Technical Assets

- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_discipline_cards_hostile_territory.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_discipline_cards_hostile_territory`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_discipline_cards_hostile_territory.py
