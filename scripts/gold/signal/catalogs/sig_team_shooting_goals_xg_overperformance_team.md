# sig_team_shooting_goals_xg_overperformance_team

## Purpose

Detect rare team matches where very high scoring output (4+ goals) is produced from low expected-goal totals (`xG < 1.5`), highlighting extreme finishing overperformance.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_goals >= 4`
  - `triggered_team_xg < 1.5`
- Trigger is evaluated on finished matches only using full-match aggregates from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`).
- Output remains bilateral with symmetric `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` features for shot volume, conversion, chance quality, possession, circulation, and territory.
- Signal severity is ranked with `goals_above_threshold`, `expected_goals_below_threshold`, and `triggered_team_goals_minus_xg`.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signal is `sig_team_shooting_goals_ruthless_efficiency`; this signal coexists because it is xG-overperformance-first (`>= 4` goals from `< 1.5` xG) rather than shots-on-target-efficiency-first (`>= 3` goals from `<= 5` shots on target).
