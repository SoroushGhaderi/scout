# sig_team_possession_passing_set_piece_focus

## Purpose

Detect teams that concentrate match attacking pressure into repeated corner-winning sequences, then profile whether the resulting set-piece focus is supported by passing control and chance quality.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: team-level `corners >= 15` in a single finished match.
- Signal emits one row per triggered side (`home` or `away`) with mirrored opponent context.
- Corner pressure is paired with set-piece end-product (`set_piece_shots`, `set_play_xg`) to distinguish sterile corner volume from dangerous corner volume.
- Passing context (`pass_attempts`, `pass_accuracy`, `opposition_half_passes`) and territory/shot context (`touches_opposition_box`, `total_shots`, `possession`) help explain whether set-piece focus emerged from sustained control.
- Dead-ball restart proxy metrics (`player_throws + corners`) quantify how much of each side's circulation came through restart actions.
