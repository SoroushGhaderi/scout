# sig_team_shooting_goals_dead_ball_specialists

## Purpose

Detect teams that produce at least two goals from dead-ball shooting situations, highlighting set-piece finishing dominance at team level.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_dead_ball_goals >= 2`
- Dead-ball goal taxonomy uses `silver.shot.situation IN ('FromCorner', 'FreeKick', 'SetPiece')` with own goals excluded (`is_own_goal = 0`).
- Trigger is evaluated independently for home and away teams in finished matches.
- Bilateral output is preserved through `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` metrics for tactical comparison.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_possession_passing_set_piece_focus` and `sig_match_possession_passing_set_piece_dominance`; this signal is distinct because it is finishing-outcome driven (`>= 2` dead-ball goals) rather than possession/restart-volume driven.
