# sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_interception_marathon

## Purpose

Flags defender profiles with marathon-level first-half interception output and preserves bilateral
defensive context, while making source-grain proxy assumptions explicit for reproducibility.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Requested trigger target: defender records `>= 5` interceptions in first half.
- Current warehouse limitation: player-level interceptions are available only at full-match grain in
  `silver.player_match_stat`; no player-period interception split exists.
- Implemented trigger proxy (explicit):
  - `triggered_player_first_half_interceptions_proxy = least(triggered_player_interceptions_full_match, triggered_team_interceptions_first_half)`
  - Signal fires when `triggered_player_first_half_interceptions_proxy >= 5`.
  - `has_first_half_period_row_flag = 1` is required for data-completeness on half-split team context.
- Defender scope and role-gate:
  - `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id = 1` from `silver.match_personnel`
  - `is_goalkeeper = 0`
  - `match_finished = 1`
- Team first-half and full-match context is sourced from `silver.period_stat` using `period IN ('FirstHalf', 'All')`.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_interception_king`: closest overlap (interception-heavy defender), but it triggers on full-match interceptions (`>= 7`) without first-half framing.
  - `sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_defensive_double_double`: related defensive-volume profile, but requires tackles + interceptions together.
  - `sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_high_line_trapper`: closest proxy-pattern overlap, but trigger axis is offsides-caught proxy, not interceptions.
