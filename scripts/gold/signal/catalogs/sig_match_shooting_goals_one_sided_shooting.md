# sig_match_shooting_goals_one_sided_shooting

## Purpose

Detect finished matches where one side owns every on-target attempt (`> 0` vs `0`) and expose bilateral finishing, chance, and control diagnostics for interpretation and downstream modeling.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_shots_on_target > 0`
  - `opponent_shots_on_target = 0`
- Trigger is evaluated on full-match team stats (`period = 'All'`) and finished matches only.
- Signal emits one side-oriented row (`triggered_side`) for the qualifying side in each match.
- Enrichment includes shot volume/accuracy/conversion, xG quality, big chances, box touches, possession, and pass-accuracy gaps.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_shot_on_target_monopoly` and `sig_team_shooting_goals_no_shots_allowed`; this signal intentionally coexists because it is match-scoped and requires exclusive on-target ownership without the high threshold (`>= 10`) used by the monopoly signal.

## Technical Assets

- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_shooting_goals_one_sided_shooting.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_shooting_goals_one_sided_shooting`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_shooting_goals_one_sided_shooting.py
