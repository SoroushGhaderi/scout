# sig_match_goalkeeping_defense_no_penetration_match

## Purpose

Detects finished matches with very low combined opposition-box touches and emits bilateral
side-oriented rows to profile defensive denial, box protection workload, and match control context.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `(coalesce(touches_opp_box_home, 0) + coalesce(touches_opp_box_away, 0)) < 15` from `silver.period_stat` at `period = 'All'`.
- Match-level trigger emits two rows (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `triggered_side = 'away'`) to preserve canonical `match_team` orientation.
- Trigger severity is exposed by `match_total_touches_opposition_box_below_threshold = 15 - match_total_touches_opposition_box`.
- Bilateral opposition-box context is preserved with raw counts, side share percentages, and deltas, then enriched with shot blocks, clearances, interceptions, tackles, duels, aerials, shot pressure faced, keeper output, possession, passing quality, and scoreline context.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_match_goalkeeping_defense_shot_block_fest`: same entity/family/subfamily and defensive workload framing, but trigger axis is high combined shot blocks (`> 15`), not low combined opposition-box entries.
  - `sig_match_goalkeeping_defense_goalless_siege_match`: same family and bilateral defensive context, but trigger requires a 0-0 plus high-xG paradox instead of territorial penetration suppression.
  - `sig_match_possession_passing_dead_zone_game`: closest low-penetration overlap, but it belongs to possession/passing and requires both sides at exactly zero opposition-box touches.
