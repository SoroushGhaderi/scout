# sig_player_shooting_goals_rapid_brace

## Purpose

Flags players who produce a rapid brace by scoring two non-own goals within ten effective minutes, isolating short-burst finishing explosions.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Non-own goal events from `silver.shot` (`is_goal = 1`, `is_own_goal = 0`).
  - Same player, same team, same match has an ordered goal pair where effective-minute gap is `<= 10`.
- Effective-minute definition is `goal_time + goal_overload_time` (fallback `minute + minute_added`), matching existing timing-based shooting signals.
- Deterministic pair selection chooses the earliest qualifying second goal (then earliest first-goal tie-break), producing stable first/second rapid-goal diagnostics.
- Bilateral team/opponent context is sourced from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) using symmetric `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` fields.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signal is `sig_player_shooting_goals_clinical_brace`; this signal is intentionally complementary because trigger logic is time-window burst finishing rather than low-xG overperformance filtering.
