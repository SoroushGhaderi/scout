# sig_team_possession_passing_possession_without_purpose

## Purpose

A team dominates possession (>65%) yet generates fewer than 2 shots on target across the full match, indicating sterile, directionless ball circulation with minimal attacking threat.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: possession above 65% with fewer than 2 shots on target for either home or away side in full-match totals (`period = 'All'`).
- This isolates matches where control of the ball failed to translate into penetration or shot quality.
- Enrichment adds progression, final-third access, xG, passing profile, and opponent defensive context to diagnose why dominance became sterile.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_possession_without_purpose.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_possession_without_purpose.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_possession_without_purpose`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_possession_without_purpose.py
```
