# sig_team_possession_passing_territorial_dominance

## Purpose

Detect team-level territorial dominance where repeated opposition-box occupation (`>= 40` touches) indicates sustained control in advanced zones.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Signal name source: `-- Signal: sig_team_possession_passing_territorial_dominance`
- Trigger condition source: `-- Trigger: Team records >= 40 touches in the opposition box.`
- Emits one row per triggered side (`home` / `away`), preserving bilateral opponent context for fair tactical interpretation.
- Enrichment combines territory (`touches`, `opposition_half_passes`) with execution quality (`pass_accuracy`) and attacking payoff (`shots`, `xg`, `xg_per_opposition_box_touch`).

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_territorial_dominance.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_territorial_dominance.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_territorial_dominance`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_territorial_dominance.py
```
