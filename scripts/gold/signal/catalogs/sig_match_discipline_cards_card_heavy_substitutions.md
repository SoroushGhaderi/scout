# sig_match_discipline_cards_card_heavy_substitutions

## Purpose

Flags matches where bench usage is strongly associated with discipline risk, defined by four or more distinct substitute players receiving yellow cards in the same fixture.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `match_distinct_substitute_yellow_carded_players >= 4`
- Substitute identity is sourced from `silver.match_personnel` where `role = 'substitute'` and `substitution_time > 0`.
- Qualifying card events are yellow-card events from `silver.card`, linked by `match_id`, `player_id`, and `team_side`.
- Trigger is match-level and emits two side-oriented rows (`home` and `away`) for stable `match_team` downstream consumption.
- Output preserves substitute-booking concentration, timing of first substitute booking by side, and bilateral discipline/control context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`).

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_discipline_cards_card_heavy_substitutions.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_card_heavy_substitutions.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_discipline_cards_card_heavy_substitutions`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_card_heavy_substitutions.py
```
