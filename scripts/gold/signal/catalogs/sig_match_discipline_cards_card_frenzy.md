# sig_match_discipline_cards_card_frenzy

## Purpose

Flags matches with extreme disciplinary volume (10+ combined cards), capturing card-heavy environments where officiating pressure and on-pitch aggression materially shape match dynamics.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `(yellow_cards_home + yellow_cards_away + red_cards_home + red_cards_away) >= 10` from `silver.period_stat` at `period = 'All'`.
- Trigger is match-level and emitted as two side-oriented rows (`home` and `away`) for stable team-grain downstream consumption.
- Output keeps bilateral card composition, share, and conversion-to-fouls context, plus defensive action and possession context for tactical interpretation.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_discipline_cards_card_frenzy.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_card_frenzy.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_discipline_cards_card_frenzy`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_card_frenzy.py
```
