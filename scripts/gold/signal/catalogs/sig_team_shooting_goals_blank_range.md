# sig_team_shooting_goals_blank_range

## Purpose

Detect team-level finishing collapses where chance creation was strong (xG > 2.5) but the team scored zero goals.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_goals = 0`
  - `triggered_team_xg > 2.5`
- Trigger evaluation uses full-match rows only (`period = 'All'`) and finished matches only.
- Signal output stays bilateral (`triggered_team_*` vs `opponent_*`) to explain whether the blank result came from poor shot execution, goalkeeper resistance, or wider tactical imbalance.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_shooting_gallery` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_wasteful_finisher`; this signal is distinct because it is team-triggered and specifically models severe zero-goal underperformance at high team xG rather than generic shot volume or player-level wastefulness.
