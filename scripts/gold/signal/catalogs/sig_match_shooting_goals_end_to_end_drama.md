# sig_match_shooting_goals_end_to_end_drama

## Purpose

Flag high-volatility matches where each side scores in both halves, then expose side-oriented half-by-half scoring plus shooting and control context to explain whether the bilateral goal flow came from sustained chance quality, shot volume, or finishing variance.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `home_first_half_goals >= 1`
  - `away_first_half_goals >= 1`
  - `home_second_half_goals >= 1`
  - `away_second_half_goals >= 1`
- Half-goal counts are derived from `silver.shot` goal events with `period in {'FirstHalf', 'SecondHalf'}` and side attribution from `is_home_goal`.
- Emits two rows per triggered match (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain.
- Enrichment emphasizes half-level scoring symmetry and bilateral shooting context (`total_shots`, `shots_on_target`, `shot_accuracy_pct`, `xg`, `shot_conversion_pct`) with possession and pass-quality context for tactical interpretation.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_match_shooting_goals_goal_fest` and `sig_match_shooting_goals_basketball_match`; this signal is distinct because trigger activation requires bilateral half-by-half scoring structure, not only aggregate goals or aggregate shot volume.
