# sig_match_creativity_playmaking_box_entry_chaos

## Purpose

Detect bilateral creativity matches with extreme combined box-entry progression volume, where teams
repeatedly move possession into advanced threat zones.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `match_combined_successful_box_passes_proxy > 50`
  - with `period = 'All'`, `match_finished = 1`, and valid `match_id`.
- Source limitation and proxy contract:
  - Direct `successful_passes_into_box` is not available in current Silver tables.
  - Signal uses `silver.player_match_stat.passes_final_third` as explicit proxy:
    - `trigger_successful_box_passes_proxy_source = 'passes_final_third_proxy'`.
- Emits one row per side (`home`, `away`) for canonical `match_team` grain and symmetric
  downstream usage.
- Bilateral context includes creativity quality (`expected_assists`, `key_passes`) plus passing,
  shot, territorial, and directness diagnostics.
- Similarity gate note:
  - Closest active signal is `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_progressive_warfare`, which also tracks progression intensity but uses an OR trigger across `passes_final_third` and `long_ball_attempts` at a higher threshold (`> 80`).
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_the_creativity_clash` is creativity-quality bilateral (`xA`) rather than box-entry progression-volume based.
  - `sig_match_shooting_goals_box_siege_match` overlaps on territorial pressure (`touches_opp_box`) but belongs to shooting outcomes, not playmaking progression.
