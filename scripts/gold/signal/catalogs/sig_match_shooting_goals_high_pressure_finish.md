# sig_match_shooting_goals_high_pressure_finish

## Purpose

Detect matches that turn into late two-sided shot pressure (10+ combined attempts after the 85th minute), then expose bilateral team context for end-game intensity, finishing quality, and control diagnostics.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: combined late shots where `effective_shot_minute = coalesce(goal_time, minute, 0) + coalesce(goal_overload_time, minute_added, 0)` and `effective_shot_minute > 85` is at least `10`.
- Late-shot rollups are computed from `silver.shot`, mapped to home/away by `team_id` against `silver.match` team IDs, then filtered to known sides only.
- Match-level trigger emits two rows (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain for downstream joins.
- Enrichment combines late-shot pressure metrics (volume, on-target load, late accuracy) with full-match shooting, xG, scoreline, chance quality, possession, and pass-execution context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`).
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_match_shooting_goals_high_volume_low_target` and `sig_match_shooting_goals_end_to_end_drama`; this signal is distinct because it is strictly late-window shot-volume driven (`85'+`), independent of full-match shot totals, target caps, or half-goal split rules.
