# sig_team_possession_passing_siege_mode

## Purpose

Triggers when a team sustains more than 80% full-match possession, indicating total territorial siege and opponent suppression.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `ball_possession_home > 80` (home trigger) or `ball_possession_away > 80` (away trigger) for `period = 'All'`.
- Signal is side-specific (`home` / `away`) and includes opponent identity for contextual analysis.
- Enrichment captures whether possession dominance is productive (xG, shots, box touches, corners, progression, and pass quality).

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_siege_mode.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_siege_mode.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_siege_mode`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_siege_mode.py
```

| `home_team_id` | ID of the home team | Football developer: anchors joins across match, team, and downstream feature tables — stable match/team reference field |
| `home_team_name` | Name of the home team | Football developer: anchors joins across match, team, and downstream feature tables — stable match/team reference field |
| `away_team_id` | ID of the away team | Football developer: anchors joins across match, team, and downstream feature tables — stable match/team reference field |
| `away_team_name` | Name of the away team | Football developer: anchors joins across match, team, and downstream feature tables — stable match/team reference field |
| `home_score` | Goals scored by the home team | Football developer: anchors joins across match, team, and downstream feature tables — stable match/team reference field |
