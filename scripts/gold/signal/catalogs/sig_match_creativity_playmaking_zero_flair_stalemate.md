# sig_match_creativity_playmaking_zero_flair_stalemate

## Purpose

Identify finished scoreless matches where neither side completes a single dribble, signaling an
extreme low-flair, low-separation creative stalemate.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `match_total_goals = 0`
  - `match_combined_successful_dribbles = 0`
  - with `period = 'All'`, `match_finished = 1`, and valid `match_id`.
- Emits one row per side (`home`, `away`) at `match_team` grain for symmetric downstream usage.
- Keeps bilateral diagnostics for chance creation and territory (key passes, xA, shots, xG,
  possession, opposition-half passes, opposition-box touches).
- Adds directness substitutes (`cross_attempts`, `long_ball_attempts`) to profile whether teams
  replaced dribbling with lower-risk progression channels.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_unproductive_beauty` is closest structurally (scoreless and
    dribble-aware), but it requires very high dribble and key-pass volume (`>= 40`, `>= 20`) rather
    than zero successful dribbles.
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_dribbling_battle` is the inverse profile, triggered by very
    high combined successful dribbles (`> 40`).
  - `sig_match_possession_passing_clean_game` overlaps on low-event control archetypes, but it is
    possession-family, not creativity/playmaking dribble-collapse logic.
