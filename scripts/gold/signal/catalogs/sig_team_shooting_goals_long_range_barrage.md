# sig_team_shooting_goals_long_range_barrage

## Purpose

Detect team-level long-range shooting overloads where a side relies heavily on outside-box attempts (`>= 10`) in a single finished match.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_shots_outside_box >= 10`
- Outside-box scope is defined from shot-location events where the attempt origin is outside the 18-yard box.
- Trigger evaluation is full-match only (`period = 'All'`) and finished matches only.
- Signal output is bilateral (`triggered_team_*` vs `opponent_*`) so analysts can evaluate whether the long-range barrage reflected tactical necessity, shot selection bias, or territorial constraints.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_shooting_gallery` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_long_range_specialist`; this signal is intentionally distinct because it is team-triggered and location-volume-first (outside-box attempts) rather than total shot volume or player-level long-range conversion.
