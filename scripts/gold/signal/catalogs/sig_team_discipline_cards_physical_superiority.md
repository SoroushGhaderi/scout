# sig_team_discipline_cards_physical_superiority

## Purpose

Flags team-match cases where a side controls the duel battle (at least 65% duel-win share) while also committing high foul volume (15 or more fouls), surfacing physically dominant but contact-heavy performances.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_duel_wins_share_pct >= 65.0`
  - `triggered_team_fouls_committed >= 15`
- Trigger is evaluated symmetrically for home and away teams using `silver.period_stat` with `period = 'All'`.
- Duel share is computed as team duels won divided by total match duels won (`home + away`), preserving bilateral duel-share, foul-share, card, defensive-action, and possession context for interpretation.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_discipline_cards_physical_superiority.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_discipline_cards_physical_superiority.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_discipline_cards_physical_superiority`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_discipline_cards_physical_superiority.py
```
