# sig_team_shooting_goals_shooting_gallery

## Purpose

Detect extreme shot-volume team matches (25+ attempts) and quantify whether the volume reflected real chance quality and sustained attacking pressure.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `coalesce(total_shots_home, 0) >= 25` (home trigger) or `coalesce(total_shots_away, 0) >= 25` (away trigger) for full-match rows (`period = 'All'`).
- Signal output is side-oriented (`triggered_side`) and includes bilateral team/opponent context for interpretable diagnostics.
- Enrichment prioritizes conversion context (`on_target_ratio_pct`, `xg_per_shot`), territorial threat (`touches_opposition_box`, corners), and possession/circulation baselines.
- Similarity gate note: closest active team-level shot context signal is `sig_team_possession_passing_shot_per_possession`; this new signal is distinct because it is absolute volume-first (`>= 25` shots) rather than passing-efficiency-first.
