# sig_team_shooting_goals_offensive_masterclass

## Purpose

Detect team matches where average chance quality per shot is elite (`xG per shot > 0.20`), surfacing compact high-quality attacking profiles rather than volume-heavy shooting alone.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_xg_per_shot > 0.20`
- Trigger is evaluated on finished matches only using full-match aggregates from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`).
- Signal keeps bilateral context with symmetric `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` metrics for chance quality, shot volume, execution, possession, circulation, and territory.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_shooting_gallery` and `sig_team_shooting_goals_xg_overperformance_team`; this signal intentionally coexists because it is average-chance-quality-first (`xG per shot > 0.20`) and does not require extreme shot volume or extreme goal-vs-xG outperformance.

## Technical Assets
