# sig_match_creativity_playmaking_shot_creation_peak

## Purpose

Detect finished matches with extreme shot-creation tempo (one shot every 3 minutes or faster),
then preserve bilateral playmaking and execution context per side.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `match_total_shots >= 30` over a 90-minute reference window.
  - Equivalent expression: `match_minutes_per_shot <= 3.0`.
- Trigger source:
  - Shot volume and match execution context come from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`).
  - Team key passes and expected assists are aggregated from `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Match scope:
  - `silver.match.match_finished = 1`
  - `match_id > 0`
- Side orientation:
  - Emits one row for `home` and one row for `away` (`match_team` grain).
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_big_chance_fest` is chance-value-volume driven (`big chances > 8`), while this signal is pure shot-creation tempo.
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_unproductive_beauty` blends dribbles + key passes + no-goal outcome, while this signal is shot-frequency focused regardless of outcome.
  - `sig_match_shooting_goals_shot_efficiency_parity` is finishing-balance logic, while this signal focuses on creation pace.
