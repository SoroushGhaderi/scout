# sig_team_discipline_cards_clean_sheet_aggression

## Purpose

Flags team-match performances where a side wins to nil while accumulating a heavy yellow-card load, surfacing disciplined-risk tradeoffs between defensive control and aggressive behavior.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_yellow_cards >= 5`
  - `opponent_goals = 0` (clean sheet)
  - `triggered_team_goals > opponent_goals` (match win)
- Trigger is evaluated symmetrically for home and away teams using `silver.match` and `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`).
- Output keeps bilateral card, foul, defensive-action, and possession context to separate productive aggression from chaotic card-heavy performances.

## Technical Assets

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_discipline_cards_clean_sheet_aggression.py
```
