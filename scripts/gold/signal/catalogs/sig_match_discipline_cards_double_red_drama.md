# sig_match_discipline_cards_double_red_drama

## Purpose

Flags bilateral dismissal matches where both teams lose at least one player to a red card, surfacing extreme-control-breakdown environments.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `red_cards_home >= 1 AND red_cards_away >= 1` from `silver.period_stat` at `period = 'All'`.
- Trigger is match-level and emitted as two side-oriented rows (`home` and `away`) for stable team-grain downstream usage.
- Output preserves red-card symmetry plus card-to-foul conversion, defensive workload, and possession context to separate balanced chaos from one-sided indiscipline.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_discipline_cards_double_red_drama.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_double_red_drama.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_discipline_cards_double_red_drama`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_discipline_cards_double_red_drama.py
```
