# sig_team_discipline_cards_zero_card_miracle

## Purpose

Flags team-match performances where foul volume is extreme (20 or more fouls) while the side avoids any yellow card, surfacing rare discipline-officiating anomalies under heavy contact pressure.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_fouls_committed >= 20`
  - `triggered_team_yellow_cards = 0`
- Trigger is evaluated symmetrically for home and away teams using `silver.period_stat` with `period = 'All'`.
- The signal preserves bilateral foul burden, yellow/red composition, defensive actions, and possession context so analysts can separate officiating asymmetry from match-state-driven physicality.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_discipline_cards_zero_card_miracle.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_discipline_cards_zero_card_miracle.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_discipline_cards_zero_card_miracle`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_discipline_cards_zero_card_miracle.py
```
