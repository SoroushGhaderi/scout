# sig_match_creativity_playmaking_big_chance_fest

## Purpose

Detect finished matches with very high combined big-chance volume (>8), highlighting bilateral
playmaking-heavy games where both sides repeatedly generate high-value opportunities.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `match_total_big_chances > 8`, where
  - `match_total_big_chances = coalesce(big_chances_home, 0) + coalesce(big_chances_away, 0)`.
- Trigger source:
  - Big-chance and match context metrics are sourced from `silver.period_stat` at `period = 'All'`.
  - Team key passes and expected assists are aggregated from `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Match scope:
  - `silver.match.match_finished = 1`
  - `match_id > 0`
- Side orientation:
  - Emits one row per side (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) with bilateral context.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_the_creativity_clash` is the closest match-level creativity sibling; it triggers on bilateral xA floors (`>= 1.5` each), while this signal is event-volume driven on combined big chances.
  - `sig_team_creativity_playmaking_big_chance_monopoly` overlaps on big-chance domain, but it is team-level monopoly logic (`triggered >= 5` and `opponent = 0`) rather than match-level bilateral high volume.
  - `sig_match_shooting_goals_goal_fest` is outcome-goal-volume focused, whereas this signal is chance-creation-value focused.
