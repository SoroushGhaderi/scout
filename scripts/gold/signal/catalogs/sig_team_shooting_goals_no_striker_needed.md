# sig_team_shooting_goals_no_striker_needed

## Purpose

Detect team-level high-scoring outputs where forwards are not required for finishing, i.e. the team scores at least three non-own goals and every scorer is classified as midfielder or defender.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_non_own_goals > 2`
  - `triggered_team_forward_non_own_goals = 0`
  - `triggered_team_non_own_goals = triggered_team_midfielder_defender_non_own_goals`
- Goal events come from `silver.shot` with `is_goal = 1` and `is_own_goal = 0`.
- Scorer role classification uses `silver.match_personnel` (`usual_playing_position_id`) with starter-priority resolution (`argMax` over `starter` then `substitute`).
- Trigger evaluation is side-specific (home and away independently) and limited to finished matches.
- Bilateral context is preserved through symmetric `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` role-composition and shooting-context metrics.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_defensive_scoring_unit` and `sig_team_shooting_goals_shared_scoring`; this signal coexists because it is role-composition constrained (no forward scorers with >2 team non-own goals) rather than defender-scorer diversity or generic scorer distribution.
