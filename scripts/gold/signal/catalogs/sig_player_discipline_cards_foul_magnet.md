# sig_player_discipline_cards_foul_magnet

## Purpose

Flags players who are fouled six or more times in a match, surfacing high-contact focal points who repeatedly draw defensive infringements.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_was_fouled >= 6`
- Player foul-drawn volume is sourced from `silver.player_match_stat.was_fouled`.
- Player card counts are sourced from `silver.card` at `match_id + player_id` grain to contextualize whether repeated contact also led to retaliation or bookings.
- Team and opponent discipline context is sourced from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) using symmetric `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` fields for fouls and cards.
- Possession context helps distinguish foul-drawing in proactive possession phases from transition or low-possession defensive match states.

## Technical Assets

- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_discipline_cards_foul_magnet.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_discipline_cards_foul_magnet`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_discipline_cards_foul_magnet.py
```

| `was_fouled_count_above_threshold` | Fouls suffered above trigger threshold (`was_fouled - 6`) | Football developer: severity measure beyond binary trigger |
| `triggered_team_total_fouls` | Fouls committed by triggered player's team | Football developer: team-level infringement environment around the triggered player |
| `opponent_total_fouls` | Fouls committed by opponent team | Football developer: bilateral infringement comparator against player-level foul-drawn volume |
| `triggered_team_total_cards` | Total cards (yellow+red) for triggered player's team | Football developer: team discipline context for referee strictness and game tone |
| `opponent_total_cards` | Total cards (yellow+red) for opponent team | Football developer: bilateral discipline comparator |
| `triggered_team_yellow_cards` | Triggered-team yellow-card count | Football developer: card-color decomposition for team discipline profiling |
