# sig_team_possession_passing_shot_per_possession

## Purpose

Detect teams that convert completed passing volume into shooting quickly, defined as at least one shot for every 20 accurate passes.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `triggered_team_accurate_passes >= 20` and `triggered_team_accurate_passes / triggered_team_total_shots <= 20` in full-match stats (`period = 'All'`).
- Captures direct or fast-progressing attacking possessions where circulation turns into attempts without long sterile buildup phases.
- Bilateral enrichment keeps opponent baselines for passing quality, territorial control, shot quality, and vertical/direct tendencies.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_shot_per_possession.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_shot_per_possession.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_shot_per_possession`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_shot_per_possession.py
```
