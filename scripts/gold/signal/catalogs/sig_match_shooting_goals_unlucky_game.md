# sig_match_shooting_goals_unlucky_game

## Purpose

Flag matches where finishing repeatedly strikes the post or crossbar (combined woodwork hits `>= 4`) and expose bilateral team context so analysts can distinguish bad finishing variance from broader chance-creation or control imbalance.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `coalesce(shots_woodwork_home, 0) + coalesce(shots_woodwork_away, 0) >= 4` at `period = 'All'` in finished matches.
- Match-level trigger emits two rows (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain for downstream team-oriented features.
- Enrichment pairs woodwork-specific diagnostics (counts, share, and side delta) with chance-quality and execution context (`xg`, `goals_minus_xg`, shot accuracy, big chances, possession, and pass accuracy).
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_match_shooting_goals_goal_fest` and `sig_match_shooting_goals_basketball_match`; this signal is distinct because it is trigger-first on *shot outcome variance* (woodwork frequency) rather than total goals or total shot volume.
