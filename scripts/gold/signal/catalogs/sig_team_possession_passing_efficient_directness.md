# sig_team_possession_passing_efficient_directness

## Purpose

Triggers when a team generates high shot volume with low possession, indicating efficient directness and transition-led threat creation.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `ball_possession < 35` and `total_shots > 5` at full match (`period = 'All'`) for home or away.
- Captures direct, transition-oriented football where threat generation is disproportionate to possession share.
- Enrichment layers differentiate clinical counter-attacking from noisy low-possession shot production.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_efficient_directness.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_efficient_directness.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_efficient_directness`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_efficient_directness.py
```
