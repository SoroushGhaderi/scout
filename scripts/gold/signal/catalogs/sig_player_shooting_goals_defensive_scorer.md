# sig_player_shooting_goals_defensive_scorer

## Purpose

Flags center backs who score from dead-ball attacking phases (corner or set-piece) to isolate defensive players providing direct scoring impact.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id = 1`
  - `triggered_player_position_id IN (3, 4)`
  - `triggered_player_set_piece_goals >= 1`
- Set-piece events are sourced from `silver.shot` where `situation IN ('FromCorner', 'SetPiece')` and own goals are excluded for goal attribution.
- Center-back scope is derived from `silver.match_personnel` using match-specific role precedence (`starter` preferred over `substitute`).
- Bilateral match context comes from `silver.match` and `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) with symmetric triggered-team/opponent metrics.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_player_shooting_goals_headers_only` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_freekick_master`; this signal is distinct because it enforces center-back identity and broader set-piece sequence scoring (not only headers or direct free-kicks).
