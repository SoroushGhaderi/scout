# sig_match_creativity_playmaking_unproductive_beauty

## Purpose

Detect finished matches where creativity volume is high (dribbles and key passes) but output is
nil (0 total goals), surfacing aesthetically rich yet unproductive attacking contests.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `match_combined_successful_dribbles >= 40`
  - `match_combined_key_passes >= 20`
  - `match_total_goals = 0`
- Aggregate sources:
  - Team key passes and expected assists come from `silver.player_match_stat`.
  - Dribbles, shots, passing, possession, and territorial context come from
    `silver.period_stat` where `period = 'All'`.
- Match scope:
  - `silver.match.match_finished = 1`
  - `match_id > 0`
- Side orientation:
  - Emits one row for `home` and one row for `away` at `match_team` grain.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_dribbling_battle` overlaps on high dribble volume, but does
    not require high key-pass volume nor zero-goal outcomes.
  - `sig_match_possession_passing_unproductive_game` overlaps on low-output outcomes, but triggers
    on pass-volume and low-shot constraints instead of creativity dribble/key-pass intensity.
  - `sig_team_creativity_playmaking_unproductive_flair` is unilateral team-level logic; this
    signal is bilateral match-level creativity/output paradox detection.
