# sig_player_possession_passing_cross_heavy

## Purpose

Triggers when a player attempts more than 12 crosses in a single match, identifying cross-heavy service profiles.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_cross_attempts > 12`
- Trigger uses player-level full-match totals from `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Signal includes bilateral team/opponent cross and pass context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to separate individual crossing volume from team-wide match dynamics.
- Output explicitly stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_player_possession_passing_cross_heavy.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_cross_heavy.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_possession_passing_cross_heavy`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_cross_heavy.py
```
