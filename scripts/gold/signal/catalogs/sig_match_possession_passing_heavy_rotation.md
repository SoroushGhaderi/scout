# sig_match_possession_passing_heavy_rotation

## Purpose

Triggers when a match has very high total touch volume but no individual touch monopolist, surfacing distributed circulation and heavy on-ball rotation.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `match_total_player_touches > 1000` and `match_max_player_touches <= 80`.
- Touch volume is computed from player-level full-match touches aggregated by team and then combined at match level.
- Emits one row per side (`triggered_side` = `home` and `away`) so downstream consumers can compare the same distributed-touch game from each team orientation.
- Enriches the trigger with side-level pass quality, possession share, territorial progression, box access, and xG context.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_match_possession_passing_heavy_rotation.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_heavy_rotation.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_match_possession_passing_heavy_rotation`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_match_possession_passing_heavy_rotation.py
```
