# sig_match_goalkeeping_defense_save_to_goal_ratio

## Purpose

Detect finished matches where shot-stopping volume is disproportionately high relative to scoring
output (`>= 10` saves per goal) and emit bilateral side-oriented context for defensive resistance,
pressure absorption, and control-state interpretation.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `(keeper_saves_home + keeper_saves_away) / (home_goals + away_goals) >= 10.0`
  with `(home_goals + away_goals) >= 1` and `period = 'All'`.
- Match-level trigger emits two rows (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `triggered_side = 'away'`) to
  preserve canonical `match_team` grain and side-oriented joins.
- Trigger severity is preserved via `match_save_to_goal_ratio` and
  `match_save_to_goal_ratio_above_threshold`.
- Enrichment remains symmetric across sides: keeper output, shot pressure faced, defensive actions,
  possession/control, passing quality, and scoreline context.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_match_goalkeeping_defense_save_fest`: strongest overlap (save-volume framing), but that signal
    uses an absolute trigger (`combined saves > 12`) while this signal is efficiency-contextualized by
    scoring output (`saves per goal >= 10`).
  - `sig_match_goalkeeping_defense_goalless_siege_match`: both can surface low-scoring pressure matches,
    but this signal requires at least one goal and is anchored to save-to-goal ratio rather than a 0-0
    high-xG paradox.
