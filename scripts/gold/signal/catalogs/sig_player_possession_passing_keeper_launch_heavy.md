# sig_player_possession_passing_keeper_launch_heavy

## Purpose

Triggers when a goalkeeper attempts at least 20 long balls, highlighting matches where distribution is heavily routed through launch-heavy keeper passing.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `p.is_goalkeeper = 1`
  - `triggered_player_long_ball_attempts >= 20`
- Trigger is computed from player-level full-match passing totals in `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Signal includes bilateral team/opponent long-ball and pass-quality context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to separate isolated goalkeeper behavior from wider team directness.
- Output explicitly stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_player_possession_passing_keeper_launch_heavy.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_keeper_launch_heavy.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_possession_passing_keeper_launch_heavy`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_keeper_launch_heavy.py
```
