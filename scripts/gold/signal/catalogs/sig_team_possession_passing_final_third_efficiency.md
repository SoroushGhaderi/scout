# sig_team_possession_passing_final_third_efficiency

## Purpose

Detect teams that score at least 2 goals despite fewer than 10 final-third entries (proxied by `touches_opp_box`), highlighting extreme attacking efficiency.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Signal name source: `-- Signal: sig_team_possession_passing_final_third_efficiency`
- Trigger condition source: `-- Trigger: team goals >= 2 with triggered_team_final_third_entries < 10 (entries proxied by touches_opp_box).`
- Signal isolates unusually clinical finishing profiles and enriches with bilateral shot quality, passing control, and territorial progression context.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_final_third_efficiency.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_final_third_efficiency.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_final_third_efficiency`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_final_third_efficiency.py
```
