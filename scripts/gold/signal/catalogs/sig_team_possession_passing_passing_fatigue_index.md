# sig_team_possession_passing_passing_fatigue_index

## Purpose

Triggers when a team's second-half pass volume is at least 30% lower than its first-half pass volume, after excluding triggered teams that received cards.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `second_half_passes <= 0.70 * first_half_passes` for home or away.
- Card exclusion: triggered team must have `yellow_cards + red_cards = 0` across first and second halves.
- Includes symmetric opponent context for pass volume, pass quality, possession, and xG swing to separate fatigue-like drop-off from game-state trade-offs.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_passing_fatigue_index.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_passing_fatigue_index.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_passing_fatigue_index`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_passing_fatigue_index.py
```
