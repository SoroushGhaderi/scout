# sig_team_shooting_goals_conversion_collapse

## Purpose

Flag team matches with extreme on-target volume but only one goal, surfacing severe finishing collapse despite sustained shot execution.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_shots_on_target >= 10`
  - `triggered_team_goals = 1`
- Trigger evaluation is full-match only (`period = 'All'`) and restricted to finished matches.
- Output preserves bilateral context (`triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*`) across conversion, xG, shot volume, and control metrics to separate pure finishing failure from overall tactical inferiority.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_blank_range` and `sig_team_shooting_goals_ruthless_efficiency`; this signal is distinct because it isolates high on-target volume with exactly one goal, rather than high-xG zero-goal blanks or low-volume high-goal conversion spikes.
