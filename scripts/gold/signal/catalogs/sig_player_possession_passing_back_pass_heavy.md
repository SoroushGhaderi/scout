# sig_player_possession_passing_back_pass_heavy

## Purpose

Triggers when a defender or midfielder has more than 70% of passes classified as backward/sideways recycling, identifying retention-heavy profiles that circulate possession more than they progress it.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_backward_sideways_pass_share_pct > 70`
  - `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id IN (1, 2)` for defender/midfielder filtering
- Because current player schema does not provide direct backward-pass or sideways-pass counts, the signal uses:
  - `triggered_player_backward_sideways_passes_proxy = max(total_passes - passes_final_third, 0)`
  - `triggered_player_backward_sideways_pass_share_pct = proxy / total_passes * 100`
- Trigger uses player-level full-match totals from `silver.player_match_stat` and role context from `silver.match_personnel`.
- Signal includes bilateral team/opponent passing, possession, and opposition-half pass context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to distinguish individual recycling from team-wide territorial style.
- Output explicitly stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.
