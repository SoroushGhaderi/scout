# sig_team_shooting_goals_no_shots_allowed

## Purpose

Detect team-level defensive suppression events where the opponent fails to register a single shot on target, and preserve bilateral attacking/control context for interpretation.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `opponent_shots_on_target = 0` at full-match scope (`period = 'All'`) in finished matches only.
- Rows are emitted at `match_team` grain with `triggered_side` orientation, so both teams can appear when both suppress on-target attempts.
- Enrichment keeps symmetric team/opponent context across outcome, volume, chance quality, and circulation to separate pure defensive control from low-event game states.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_ruthless_efficiency` and `sig_team_shooting_goals_shooting_gallery`; this signal is distinct because it is suppression-first (opponent on-target attempts fixed at zero), not conversion-first or own shot-volume-first.
