# sig_match_shooting_goals_goalless_siege

## Purpose

Detect goalless matches where shot volume is extreme for at least one side, then expose bilateral context to diagnose whether the stalemate came from poor finishing, goalkeeper resistance, or asymmetric attacking pressure.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `coalesce(home_score, 0) = 0`, `coalesce(away_score, 0) = 0`, and `(coalesce(total_shots_home, 0) >= 25 OR coalesce(total_shots_away, 0) >= 25)` at `period = 'All'`.
- Match-level trigger emits two side-oriented rows (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain for downstream joins and feature pipelines.
- Enrichment keeps the stalemate explainable with bilateral shot-share, shot-accuracy, xG, big-chance waste, box-touch penetration, possession, and pass-quality diagnostics.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_shooting_gallery` and `sig_match_shooting_goals_boring_stalemate`; this signal is distinct because it combines a strict goalless outcome (`0-0`) with one-sided extreme shot volume (`>= 25` by either team), rather than pure team-level volume or low-event stalemate logic.
