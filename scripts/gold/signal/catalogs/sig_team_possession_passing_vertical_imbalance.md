# sig_team_possession_passing_vertical_imbalance

## Purpose

Capture matches where a trailing team goes heavily direct (`>=60` long-ball attempts) and measure vertical-usage imbalance versus the opponent.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: team is trailing and has `long_ball_attempts >= 60`.
- Signal emits one row per triggered side and aligns all `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` fields to that side.
- Enrichment tracks long-ball volume/efficiency, pass-profile divergence, and output quality context (`xg`, shots, possession, aerial success).

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_vertical_imbalance.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_vertical_imbalance.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_vertical_imbalance`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_vertical_imbalance.py
```
