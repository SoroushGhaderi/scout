# sig_player_possession_passing_target_man_aerials

## Purpose

Triggers when a forward wins at least 10 aerial duels, flagging target-man behavior as a proxy for direct long-ball possession routes.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id = 3`
  - `triggered_player_aerial_duels_won >= 10`
- Forward classification uses `silver.match_personnel.usual_playing_position_id = 3`, with match-specific `position_id` preserved for role diagnostics.
- Trigger uses player-level duel totals from `silver.player_match_stat`, with success rate and attempts retained to separate pure volume from efficiency.
- Signal includes bilateral team/opponent aerial, long-ball, passing, and possession context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to explain whether the trigger reflects a broader direct-play plan.
- Output explicitly stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.

## Technical Assets

- Target table: `gold.sig_player_possession_passing_target_man_aerials`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_target_man_aerials.py
```
