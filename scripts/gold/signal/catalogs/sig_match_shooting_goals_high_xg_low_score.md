# sig_match_shooting_goals_high_xg_low_score

## Purpose

Detect matches with extreme combined chance creation but very low scoring output, then expose bilateral team context to diagnose collective finishing collapse and shot-conversion underperformance.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `(coalesce(expected_goals_home, 0) + coalesce(expected_goals_away, 0)) > 4.0` and `(coalesce(home_score, 0) + coalesce(away_score, 0)) <= 1` at `period = 'All'`.
- Match-level trigger emits two rows (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain for downstream modeling and feature joins.
- Enrichment emphasizes xG-versus-goals inefficiency, bilateral shot and on-target volume, conversion rate, big-chance waste, plus possession and pass-accuracy context.
- Similarity gate note: nearest active signals are `sig_match_shooting_goals_goal_fest` and `sig_match_shooting_goals_boring_stalemate`; this signal remains distinct because it requires an extreme high combined xG floor (`> 4.0`) with a strict low-score cap (`<= 1`), focusing on missed-finishing outcomes rather than high scoring or low-event stalemates.
