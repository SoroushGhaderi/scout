# sig_player_possession_passing_impact_sub_passing

## Purpose

Identifies substitute appearances where a player contributes unusually high completed-pass volume in a short cameo window.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_accurate_passes > 15`
  - `triggered_player_minutes_played < 20`
- Substituted-player scope is enforced by joining `silver.match_personnel` with:
  - `role = 'substitute'`
- Reliability guard:
  - `triggered_player_minutes_played > 0`
- Signal enriches with bilateral passing, possession, and own-half pass-share context (`triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*`) to separate true tempo impact from overall team game state.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_player_possession_passing_impact_sub_passing.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_impact_sub_passing.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_possession_passing_impact_sub_passing`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_impact_sub_passing.py
```
