# sig_team_shooting_goals_rapid_response_goal

## Purpose

Detect team-level bounce-back scoring where a side responds immediately after conceding, scoring within two effective minutes.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Non-own goal events from `silver.shot` (`is_goal = 1`, `is_own_goal = 0`).
  - A team scores on the next match goal event after conceding, with effective-minute gap `<= 2`.
- Effective-minute uses `goal_time + goal_overload_time` (fallback `minute + minute_added`) to keep timing deterministic across stoppage-time records.
- Trigger is evaluated bilaterally at `match_team` grain (`triggered_side`), allowing both sides to trigger in one match.
- Response diagnostics preserve first concede and first response timing, response-gap intensity, and symmetric opponent comparators.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_early_blitz` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_rapid_brace`; this signal is distinct because it models opponent-goal reaction speed, not pure early-window burst scoring or player-level brace bursts.
