# sig_team_goalkeeping_defense_wing_lockdown_collective

## Purpose

Detect team-level wing-lane defensive intensity matches where fullback and winger role proxies combine for extreme tackle output, while preserving bilateral defensive workload, control, and result context.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_fullbacks_and_wingers_tackles_won >= 15`
  - finished-match scope (`match_finished = 1`) with full-match context (`period = 'All'`)
- Role-gating implementation:
  - fullback proxy: `usual_playing_position_id = 1` and `position_id IN (2, 5)`
  - winger proxy: `usual_playing_position_id = 3` and `position_id IN (2, 4)`
  - player stats from `silver.player_match_stat` and position metadata from `silver.match_personnel` with starter-priority resolution.
- Rows are emitted at `match_team` grain with canonical `triggered_side`, so either side can trigger.
- Trigger severity is preserved with `triggered_team_fullbacks_and_wingers_tackles_won_above_threshold`.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_team_goalkeeping_defense_tackle_volume_surge`: same family and tackle intensity framing, but trigger uses all-team tackles (`>= 25`) rather than fullback+winger subset tackles.
  - `sig_team_goalkeeping_defense_wide_blockade`: same wing-defense theme, but trigger is crossing suppression under volume, not tackle concentration by wide-role players.
  - `sig_team_goalkeeping_defense_parking_the_bus`: same defensive resistance context style, but trigger is low-possession win with clearances, not wide-role tackle aggregation.
