# sig_player_discipline_cards_instant_impact_red

## Purpose

Flags substitute players dismissed within 10 minutes of entering, surfacing immediate high-cost discipline impact from the bench.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `minutes_from_substitution_to_dismissal <= 10`
- Substitute entry time is sourced from `silver.match_personnel` rows where `role = 'substitute'`.
- Dismissal events are sourced from `silver.card`; qualifying events are straight red cards or second-yellow dismissals.
- The signal emits one row per triggered substitute player per match using the earliest qualifying dismissal event after substitution.
- Output preserves full player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and team identity (`triggered_team_*`) at player grain.
- Bilateral team context (cards, fouls, possession, passing) is attached from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to support tactical interpretation and QA.
