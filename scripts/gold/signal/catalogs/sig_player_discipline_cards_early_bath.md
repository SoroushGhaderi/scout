# sig_player_discipline_cards_early_bath

## Purpose

Triggers when a player is sent off in the opening 20 minutes, flagging severe early discipline disruption with bilateral team context.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_red_card_minute <= 20`
- Red-card events come from `silver.card` rows where `card_type` contains `"red"`.
- The signal emits one row per triggered player per match using the first qualifying early red-card event.
- Output stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for player-grain traceability.
- Bilateral team context (cards, fouls, possession, passing) is attached from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to support interpretation of downstream tactical impact.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_player_discipline_cards_early_bath.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_discipline_cards_early_bath.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_discipline_cards_early_bath`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_discipline_cards_early_bath.py
```
