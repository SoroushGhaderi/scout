# sig_team_shooting_goals_defensive_scoring_unit

## Purpose

Detect team-level matches where defensive players provide distributed scoring output (at least two distinct defender scorers), highlighting dead-ball and back-line attacking contribution patterns.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_distinct_defender_goal_scorers >= 2`
- Defender identity is derived from `silver.match_personnel` via `usual_playing_position_id = 1` with starter-preferred role precedence.
- Scoring events are non-own goals from `silver.shot`; trigger is evaluated separately for home and away sides in finished matches.
- Bilateral output pairs defender-scoring metrics and broader shooting context as `triggered_team_*` versus `opponent_*` columns.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_shared_scoring` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_defensive_scorer`; this signal is intentionally distinct because it is team-triggered and requires multi-defender scorer diversity (`>= 2`) rather than all-player spread or single-player defensive scoring.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_shooting_goals_defensive_scoring_unit.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_shooting_goals_defensive_scoring_unit.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_shooting_goals_defensive_scoring_unit`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_shooting_goals_defensive_scoring_unit.py
```
