# sig_player_possession_passing_switch_expert

## Purpose

Triggers when a player completes more than 5 successful switches of play, using `accurate_long_balls` from `silver.player_match_stat` as the diagonal long-ball proxy.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_successful_switches_proxy > 5`
- Trigger is computed from player-level full-match passing totals in `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Because explicit switch-of-play events are not available, `accurate_long_balls` is used as a diagonal switch proxy.
- Signal includes bilateral team/opponent long-ball and pass-quality context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to distinguish isolated player switching behavior from broader team directness.
- Output explicitly stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.
