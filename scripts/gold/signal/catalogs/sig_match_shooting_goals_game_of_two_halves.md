# sig_match_shooting_goals_game_of_two_halves

## Purpose

Flag matches that are scoreless before halftime but turn into high-scoring second-half contests, then expose side-oriented goal-flow, shooting efficiency, and control context for tactical interpretation.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `match_total_first_half_goals = 0`
  - `match_total_second_half_goals >= 4`
- Half-goal counts come from `silver.shot` goal events with `period in {'FirstHalf', 'SecondHalf'}` and home/away attribution via `is_home_goal`.
- Triggered matches emit two rows (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain.
- Enrichment combines half-level scoring decomposition (`second_half_goals_above_threshold`, second-half side shares) with bilateral shooting and possession context for explainability.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_match_shooting_goals_end_to_end_drama` and `sig_match_shooting_goals_goal_fest`; this signal is distinct because it requires a strict half-split structure (goalless first half plus second-half surge), not bilateral scoring in each half or only high aggregate goals.
