# sig_player_shooting_goals_first_half_dominator

## Purpose

Flags players who score at least two non-own goals in the first half, isolating matches where one player dominates scoring output before the break.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Non-own goal events from `silver.shot` where `is_goal = 1`, `is_own_goal = 0`, and `period = 'FirstHalf'`.
  - Player has `triggered_player_first_half_goals >= 2` in the same finished match.
- Timing logic:
  - Event timing uses `goal_time + goal_overload_time` (fallback `minute + minute_added`) to retain stoppage-time precision inside first-half boundaries.
  - Earliest and latest first-half goal timings are preserved for tempo and sequence analysis.
- Match-context enrichment:
  - Player finishing context comes from `silver.player_match_stat` (goals, xG, shots, shots on target, minutes).
  - Bilateral team/opponent context comes from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) and final score context from `silver.match`.
  - Additional first-half team scoring context comes from first-half non-own `silver.shot` goal aggregates for triggered team and opponent.
- Similarity note:
  - Closest active signals are `sig_player_shooting_goals_hat_trick_hero` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_rapid_brace`.
  - This signal is intentionally distinct because it targets half-time timing dominance (`FirstHalf`, `>= 2` goals) rather than full-match high-volume output (`>= 3`) or short-window burst pacing (`<= 10` minutes).
