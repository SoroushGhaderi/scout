# sig_team_possession_passing_accurate_unit

## Purpose

Triggers when a team records elite full-match pass accuracy above `92%`, flagging highly synchronized possession units.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `triggered_team_pass_accuracy_pct > 92.0` from `silver.period_stat` rows where `period = 'All'`.
- Signal emits side-oriented rows (`home` / `away`), so both teams can trigger in the same match.
- Enrichment retains bilateral passing volume, field-territory distribution, possession share, and shot/xG context to distinguish sterile control from productive precision.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_accurate_unit.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_accurate_unit.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_accurate_unit`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_accurate_unit.py
```
