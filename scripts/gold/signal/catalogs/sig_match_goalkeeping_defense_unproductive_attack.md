# sig_match_goalkeeping_defense_unproductive_attack

## Purpose

Detect defensive wins where one side absorbs very high shot volume, blocks an extreme number of attempts, and still wins, then preserve bilateral context to explain how attacking pressure became unproductive.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition for each side at `period = 'All'`:
  - opponent total shots `>= 25`
  - triggered-side shot blocks `>= 15`
  - triggered side wins (`triggered_team_goals > opponent_goals`)
- Rows are emitted at canonical `match_team` grain with `triggered_side` (`home` or `away`), but only the winning defensive side can trigger in a match.
- Trigger severity is explicit through `triggered_team_shot_blocks_above_threshold = triggered_team_shot_blocks - 15`.
- Enrichment preserves bilateral diagnostics for pressure faced, shot-block and save efficiency, defensive actions, control state, passing execution, and outcome.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_match_goalkeeping_defense_shot_block_fest`: closest defensive block overlap, but that signal is match-triggered on combined blocks (`home + away > 15`) and does not require win or high opponent shot volume.
  - `sig_match_shooting_goals_unproductive_dominance`: closest unproductive-attack framing, but that signal triggers the attacking side on high shots with zero big chances, not the winning defensive side on shot blocks.
  - `sig_team_goalkeeping_defense_low_block_success`: same family/subfamily and defensive workload context, but trigger axis is interception volume rather than high-opponent-shots plus high blocks plus win.
