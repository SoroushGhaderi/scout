# sig_player_shooting_goals_one_man_army

## Purpose

Detects player-level 1-0 match winners where one player scores the only non-own goal for their team and directly owns the full scoring outcome.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Match must be finished (`match_finished = 1`).
  - Triggered player's team must finish with exactly one goal and concede zero.
  - Triggered player must score exactly one non-own goal (`is_goal = 1`, `is_own_goal = 0`), which is by definition the team's only goal.
- Match/player grain:
  - Goal events are grouped at `match_id + team_id + player_id` grain.
  - Signal emits one row per qualifying player and preserves first-goal timing plus score-state transition fields.
- Match-context enrichment:
  - Player finishing context comes from `silver.player_match_stat`.
  - Bilateral team/opponent context comes from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) and `silver.match`.
- Similarity note:
  - Closest active signal is `sig_player_shooting_goals_winning_impact`.
  - Coexistence decision: keep both active. `winning_impact` covers one-goal wins broadly, while `one_man_army` is a stricter 1-0 single-scorer subset.
