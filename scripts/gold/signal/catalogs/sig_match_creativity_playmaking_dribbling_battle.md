# sig_match_creativity_playmaking_dribbling_battle

## Purpose

Detect finished matches with very high combined successful dribble volume (>40), highlighting
high-tempo bilateral dribbling contests and preserving playmaking and execution context per side.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `match_combined_successful_dribbles > 40`, where
  - `match_combined_successful_dribbles = coalesce(dribbles_succeeded_home, 0) + coalesce(dribbles_succeeded_away, 0)`.
- Trigger source:
  - Dribble, shot, passing, possession, and territorial match context metrics are sourced from
    `silver.period_stat` at `period = 'All'`.
  - Team key passes and expected assists are aggregated from `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Match scope:
  - `silver.match.match_finished = 1`
  - `match_id > 0`
- Side orientation:
  - Emits one row per side (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) with bilateral context.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_big_chance_fest` is the closest sibling in this family but
    it triggers on combined big-chance volume (>8) rather than dribble completion volume.
  - `sig_team_creativity_playmaking_dribbling_exhibition` is team-level and unilateral, while
    this signal is match-level with bilateral side output.
  - `sig_match_possession_passing_dribble_fest` overlaps on dribble activity in possession family,
    while this signal sits in creativity/playmaking and enriches with key-pass/xA context.
