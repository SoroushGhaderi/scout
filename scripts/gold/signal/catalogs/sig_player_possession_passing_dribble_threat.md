# sig_player_possession_passing_dribble_threat

## Purpose

Triggers when a player completes more than 5 successful dribbles in a single match, identifying high-impact ball carriers who repeatedly beat opponents 1v1.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_successful_dribbles > 5`
- Trigger uses player-level full-match totals from `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Signal includes player dribble attempts, failed dribbles, success rate, touches, box involvement, creation, shooting, and passing context to separate pure carrying threat from sterile volume.
- Signal includes bilateral team/opponent dribbling, passing, possession, and opposition-box context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to distinguish individual superiority from team-wide carrying dominance.
- Output explicitly stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_player_possession_passing_dribble_threat.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_dribble_threat.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_possession_passing_dribble_threat`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_dribble_threat.py
```
