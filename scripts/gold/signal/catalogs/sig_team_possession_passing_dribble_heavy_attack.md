# sig_team_possession_passing_dribble_heavy_attack

## Purpose

Triggers when a team attempts at least 25 dribbles in a match, identifying aggressive carry-led attacking behavior and high 1v1 intent.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `triggered_team_dribble_attempts >= 25` at full match (`period = 'All'`).
- Emits one row per qualifying side (`triggered_side in {'home','away'}`); if both teams qualify, both rows are emitted.
- Adds bilateral dribble efficiency, passing quality, possession, penalty-box touch volume, shooting, and xG context to separate productive carrying attacks from low-yield dribble volume.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_team_possession_passing_dribble_heavy_attack.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_dribble_heavy_attack.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_team_possession_passing_dribble_heavy_attack`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_team_possession_passing_dribble_heavy_attack.py
```
