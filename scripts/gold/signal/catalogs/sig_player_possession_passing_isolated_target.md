# sig_player_possession_passing_isolated_target

## Purpose

Triggers when a forward records fewer than 5 touches while playing more than 45 minutes, identifying isolated attacking targets who were on the pitch long enough to matter but barely entered the possession chain.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id = 3`
  - `triggered_player_minutes_played > 45`
  - `triggered_player_touches < 5`
- Forward classification uses `silver.match_personnel.usual_playing_position_id = 3`, with the match-specific `position_id` also stored for formation diagnostics.
- Trigger uses player-level full-match totals from `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Signal includes bilateral team/opponent pass, possession, box-touch, xG, and shot context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to distinguish tactical isolation from general team scarcity.
- Output explicitly stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.

| `triggered_player_minutes_played` | Minutes played by triggered player | Football developer: core trigger guard (`> 45`) to remove cameo noise |
| `triggered_player_touches` | Total touches by triggered player | Football developer: core signal value and trigger metric (`< 5`) |

| `opponent_pass_accuracy_pct` | Opponent team pass accuracy | Football developer: bilateral quality reference for matchup balance |
| `triggered_team_possession_pct` | Triggered side possession percentage | Football developer: distinguishes low-team-possession isolation from role-specific exclusion |
| `opponent_possession_pct` | Opponent possession percentage | Football developer: bilateral possession comparator |
| `triggered_team_touches_opp_box` | Triggered team touches inside opposition box | Football developer: team territorial threat context for forward starvation |
| `opponent_touches_opp_box` | Opponent touches inside the triggered team's box | Football developer: symmetric territorial threat comparator |
