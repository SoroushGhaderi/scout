# sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_unbeatable_duelist

## Purpose

Flags defender performances with high-volume and high-efficiency combined duel output (`ground + aerial`) so physical dominance can be tracked with player-level and bilateral team context.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_total_duels_won = coalesce(ground_duels_won, 0) + coalesce(aerial_duels_won, 0) >= 12`
  - `triggered_player_total_duel_success_pct = 100 * total_duels_won / total_duel_attempts > 80`
  - `triggered_player_total_duel_attempts = coalesce(ground_duel_attempts, 0) + coalesce(aerial_duel_attempts, 0)`
  - `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id = 1` (defender scope)
  - `is_goalkeeper = 0`
  - `match_finished = 1`
- Defender scope is resolved from `silver.match_personnel` with starter-priority position selection per `(match_id, player_id)`.
- Player diagnostics preserve duel splits (ground vs aerial), tackling, interceptions, clearances, defensive actions, recoveries, and passing context.
- Bilateral team context is sourced from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) with symmetric `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` metrics.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_aerial_stronghold`: close overlap in defender duel profile, but that signal triggers on aerial wins only (`>= 10`) and not combined duel efficiency.
  - `sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_unbeaten_in_air`: close aerial-efficiency overlap, but it requires perfect aerial record (`100%`, aerial-only) rather than total duel profile (`ground + aerial`, `> 80%`).
  - `sig_player_goalkeeping_defense_tackle_master`: same family/subfamily and defender role, but trigger axis is perfect tackling (`>= 6` tackles at `100%`), not combined duel dominance.
