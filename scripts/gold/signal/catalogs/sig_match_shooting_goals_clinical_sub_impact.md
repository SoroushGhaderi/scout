# sig_match_shooting_goals_clinical_sub_impact

## Purpose

Detect matches where substitutes score at least three non-own goals in aggregate, then emit bilateral team context to analyze whether bench finishing swung the match profile.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `match_substitute_non_own_goals >= 3` in finished matches.
- Substitute scorers are derived from `silver.match_personnel` where `role = 'substitute'` and `substitution_time > 0`.
- A substitute goal event is counted only when a non-own goal in `silver.shot` occurs at or after that player's substitution minute.
- Match-level trigger is represented at canonical `match_team` grain by emitting two rows (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`).
- Output blends match-level substitute-goal concentration with side-oriented shooting, chance-quality, possession, and passing context.
- Similarity gate note: nearest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_bench_goals_impact` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_super_sub_goal`; this signal is distinct because the trigger is match-level aggregate substitute scoring (`>= 3`) rather than team-only (`>= 2`) or player-specific immediate impact.
