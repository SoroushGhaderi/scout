# sig_team_possession_passing_press_resistance

## Purpose

Triggers when a team keeps pass accuracy above 85% under a high-press proxy from the opponent, indicating press resistance in possession.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition (per side, full match period `All`):
  - `triggered_team_pass_acc_pct > 85`
  - `triggered_team_pass_attempts >= 300`
  - `opponent_press_actions >= 35`
  - `opponent_press_actions_per_100_triggered_passes >= 10.0`
- High-press proxy uses opponent defensive disruption volume:
  - `interceptions + tackles_succeeded + fouls`
- Signal keeps bilateral context fields so analysts can compare triggered team control quality against opponent pressure intensity and territory profile.
