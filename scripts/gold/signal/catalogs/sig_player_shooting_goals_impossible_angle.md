# sig_player_shooting_goals_impossible_angle

## Purpose

Detects match-player events where a player scores from an ultra-low-probability shot (`expected_goals < 0.02`), surfacing "impossible-angle"-like finishes through a strict shot-quality threshold.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Shot-level scope is `expected_goals < 0.02` in `silver.shot`.
  - Goal events require `is_goal = 1` and exclude own goals (`is_own_goal = 0`).
  - Signal fires when `triggered_player_low_expected_goals_goals >= 1` in the same finished match.
- Identity and orientation:
  - Player identity is preserved via `triggered_player_*`.
  - Team/opponent context is preserved via `triggered_team_*`, `opponent_*`, and `triggered_side`.
- Match-context enrichment:
  - Trigger evidence is aggregated from `silver.shot` at `match_id + player_id + team_id` grain.
  - Player shooting totals come from `silver.player_match_stat`.
  - Bilateral team/opponent context comes from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) and `silver.match`.
- Similarity gate note:
  - Closest active shooting-goals signals are `sig_player_shooting_goals_long_range_specialist` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_clutch_equalizer`; this signal is distinct because it is probability-threshold-based (`expected_goals < 0.02`) rather than location-only (outside box) or timing/state-change based (late equalizer).
