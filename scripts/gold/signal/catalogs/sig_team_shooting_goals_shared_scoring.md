# sig_team_shooting_goals_shared_scoring

## Purpose

Detect team scoring performances where goals are distributed across at least four different scorers, highlighting low-concentration finishing profiles instead of one- or two-player dependency.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_team_distinct_goal_scorers >= 4`
- Scorer diversity is computed from non-own goals in `silver.shot` at match-team grain.
- Trigger is evaluated separately for home and away sides in finished matches (`period = 'All'`).
- Bilateral output keeps scorer-diversity and shooting-control context as `triggered_team_*` vs `opponent_*` metrics.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_early_blitz` and `sig_player_shooting_goals_one_man_army`; this signal is distinct because it is team-level scorer-diversity driven (`>= 4` distinct scorers) rather than timing bursts or single-player goal concentration.
