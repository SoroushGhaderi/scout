# sig_player_possession_passing_deep_playmaker

## Purpose

Triggers when a center back records at least 80 accurate passes, highlighting deep defensive distributors who dictate buildup volume.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_usual_playing_position_id = 1` (defender scope)
  - `triggered_player_position_id IN (3, 4)` (center-back proxy in lineup positions)
  - `triggered_player_accurate_passes >= 80`
- Uses `silver.player_match_stat` for player passing output and `silver.match_personnel` for positional gating.
- Adds bilateral team/opponent passing context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) so high center-back distribution can be interpreted against possession load and build-up style.
- Preserves player and team identity fields for contract-compliant downstream joins.
