# sig_match_goalkeeping_defense_physical_duels_peak

## Purpose

Detects finished matches where total physical duel volume is extreme and emits bilateral side-oriented rows so duel burden, defensive workload, control context, and outcomes can be compared symmetrically.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `(coalesce(duels_won_home, 0) + coalesce(duels_won_away, 0) + coalesce(aerials_won_home, 0) + coalesce(aerials_won_away, 0)) > 200` from `silver.period_stat` at `period = 'All'`.
- Only finished matches are included (`silver.match.match_finished = 1`) with valid `match_id > 0`.
- Match-level trigger emits two rows (`triggered_side = 'home'` and `'away'`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain.
- Trigger severity is exposed by `match_total_combined_duels_won_above_threshold`, with decomposition into `match_total_ground_duels_won` and `match_total_aerial_duels_won`.
- Side asymmetry is measured via `match_physical_duels_balance_abs` and bilateral share/delta fields.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_match_goalkeeping_defense_aerial_battleground`: same entity/family/subfamily and bilateral shape, but trigger axis is aerial-only (`combined aerials > 60`) rather than total physical duels.
  - `sig_match_goalkeeping_defense_tackle_war`: same match-level defensive-intensity framing, but trigger is tackles-only (`combined tackles > 40`), not ground+aerial duel volume.
  - `sig_match_goalkeeping_defense_interruption_heavy`: same family and bilateral context pattern, but trigger dimension is stoppage intensity (`fouls + offsides`) instead of physical contest volume.
