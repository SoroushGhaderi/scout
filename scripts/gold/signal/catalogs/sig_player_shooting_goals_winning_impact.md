# sig_player_shooting_goals_winning_impact

## Purpose

Detects player-level match-winning finishing events where the triggered player scores the decisive winning goal and the final scoreline margin is exactly one goal.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - Goal event is a non-own goal (`is_goal = 1`, `is_own_goal = 0`) by a valid player/team.
  - Triggered player's team wins the match by exactly one goal (`abs(home_score - away_score) = 1`).
  - Goal is decisive for that one-goal win, meaning removing that goal from the winner would drop the final result from win to draw.
- Match/player grain:
  - Candidate decisive events are grouped at `match_id + team_id + player_id` to emit one row per triggered player per match.
  - First decisive-goal timing and before/after score state are preserved for auditability and downstream sequence modeling.
- Match-context enrichment:
  - Player finishing context is sourced from `silver.player_match_stat` (goals, expected goals, shots, shots on target, shot accuracy proxy, minutes).
  - Bilateral team/opponent context is sourced from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) and `silver.match`.
- Similarity note:
  - Closest active signal is `sig_player_shooting_goals_clutch_equalizer`; this signal is distinct because it targets decisive winning contribution in one-goal victories, not late parity restoration.
