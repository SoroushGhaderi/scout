# sig_match_creativity_playmaking_long_ball_duel

## Purpose

Detect bilateral direct-play creativity matches where both teams complete at least 15 long balls,
then preserve side-by-side execution and chance-creation context.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger conditions:
  - `accurate_long_balls_home >= 15`
  - `accurate_long_balls_away >= 15`
  - with `match_finished = 1`, `period = 'All'`, and `match_id > 0`.
- Long-ball completion metrics are sourced from `silver.period_stat`:
  - `accurate_long_balls_{home|away}` (completed long balls)
  - `long_ball_attempts_{home|away}` (attempt volume)
- Creative context is enriched with team key passes and expected assists aggregated from
  `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Output emits two rows per qualified match (`triggered_side = home|away`) for canonical
  `match_team` grain and symmetric bilateral modeling.
- Similarity gate note:
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_progressive_warfare` uses long-ball attempts as one proxy
    branch with a combined threshold (`> 80`), while this signal is strict bilateral completion
    (`accurate_long_balls >= 15` each).
  - `sig_match_creativity_playmaking_box_entry_chaos` is progression-proxy focused
    (`passes_final_third`) and not long-ball completion constrained.
  - `sig_match_possession_passing_keeper_playmaking_battle` tracks possession/keeper dynamics,
    while this signal is creativity/playmaking bilateral directness.
