# sig_match_shooting_goals_basketball_match

## Purpose

Flag end-to-end matches where both sides sustain very high shot volume (20+ each), then expose side-oriented context to explain whether the shot-trading pattern came from balanced attacking pressure or asymmetric finishing quality.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition: `coalesce(total_shots_home, 0) >= 20` and `coalesce(total_shots_away, 0) >= 20` at `period = 'All'`.
- Emits one row per side (`triggered_side in {'home', 'away'}`) to preserve canonical `match_team` grain and keep downstream features team-oriented.
- Enrichment emphasizes bilateral shot volume, on-target execution, xG and big-chance quality, plus possession and passing context.
- Similarity gate note: closest active signals are `sig_team_shooting_goals_shooting_gallery` and `sig_match_shooting_goals_goal_fest`; this signal is distinct because it is match-level and requires both teams to clear a symmetric shot threshold (`>= 20` each), rather than one-side-only volume or a goals-first trigger.
