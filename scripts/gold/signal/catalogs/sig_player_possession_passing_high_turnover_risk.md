# sig_player_possession_passing_high_turnover_risk

## Purpose

Triggers when a player loses possession more than 25 times in a single match, flagging high turnover-risk possession profiles.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_possession_losses > 25`
- Player possession losses are computed as:
  - `failed_passes + failed_dribbles + duels_lost`
  - where `failed_passes = max(total_passes - accurate_passes, 0)`
  - and `failed_dribbles = max(dribble_attempts - successful_dribbles, 0)`
- Trigger uses player-level full-match totals from `silver.player_match_stat`.
- Signal includes bilateral team/opponent passing, dribbling, and possession context from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) to distinguish individual ball-security risk from overall match dynamics.
- Output explicitly stores both player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and triggered-team identity (`triggered_team_*`) for contract-compliant player signal traceability.

## Technical Assets

- SQL: `clickhouse/gold/signal/sig_player_possession_passing_high_turnover_risk.sql`
- Runner: `scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_high_turnover_risk.py`
- Target table: `gold.sig_player_possession_passing_high_turnover_risk`

## Example Execution

```bash
python scripts/gold/signal/runners/sig_player_possession_passing_high_turnover_risk.py
```
