# sig_player_discipline_cards_double_yellow_dismissal

## Purpose

Flags players dismissed via second-yellow dynamics, preserving trigger timing and bilateral match context for discipline-impact analysis.

## Tactical And Statistical Logic

- Trigger condition:
  - `triggered_player_yellow_cards_match >= 2`
  - a second-yellow dismissal event is detected in `silver.card` (`card_type`/`description` patterns such as "second yellow", "yellowred", or yellow+red compound labels).
- The signal emits one row per triggered player per match.
- Trigger timing keeps both the first yellow minute and second-yellow dismissal minute.
- Output stores full player identity (`triggered_player_*`) and team identity (`triggered_team_*`) at player grain.
- Bilateral team context (fouls, cards, possession, and passing) is added from `silver.period_stat` (`period = 'All'`) using symmetric `triggered_team_*` and `opponent_*` fields.

## Technical Assets
