-- ============================================================
-- Signal: sig_team_possession_passing_death_by_passes
-- Intent: Identify matches where a team accumulates >50 touches
--         in the opposition box across the full match — a proxy
--         for sustained, suffocating final-third dominance that
--         signals siege-style possession, relentless overloads,
--         or an opponent pinned into a deep defensive block.
--         Columns are resolved dynamically: triggered_team_* is
--         always the side that fired the signal; opponent_* is
--         always the other side. When both sides trigger, the
--         home team is treated as the primary triggered team.
