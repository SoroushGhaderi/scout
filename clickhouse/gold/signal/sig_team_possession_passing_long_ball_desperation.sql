-- ============================================================
-- Signal: sig_team_possession_passing_long_ball_desperation
-- Intent: Detect matches where the losing team attempts more
--         than 60 long balls — a tactical fingerprint of
--         desperation: a side unable to build through the lines
--         resorting to direct, bypassing distribution to chase
--         the game. High long-ball volume under a losing scoreline
--         signals pressing discomfort, midfield bypass, aerial
--         overload attempts, or a complete breakdown in
--         structured build-up play.
--         Trigger resolves to the losing side only; draws are
--         excluded by construction since neither team is losing.
