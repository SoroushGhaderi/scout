-- Signal: sig_match_shooting_goals_penalty_decided_match
-- Intent: detect low-score finished matches where every recorded goal is scored from
--         a penalty and emit side-oriented rows for bilateral shooting and control context.
-- Trigger: scoreline is 1-0, 0-1, or 1-1 and match_total_penalty_goals = match_total_goals.
