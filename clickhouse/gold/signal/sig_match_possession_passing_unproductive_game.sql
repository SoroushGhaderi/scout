-- Signal: sig_match_possession_passing_unproductive_game
-- Intent: Detect matches with very high circulation but very low shot output,
--         then orient each row to one side for symmetric team-context analysis.
-- Trigger: Total match pass attempts > 1000 and total match shots < 10 at period='All'.
