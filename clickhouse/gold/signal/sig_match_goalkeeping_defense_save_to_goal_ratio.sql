-- Signal: sig_match_goalkeeping_defense_save_to_goal_ratio
-- Intent: detect finished matches where keeper saves are very high relative to goals scored,
--         preserving bilateral defensive workload and control context at match-team grain.
-- Trigger: combined keeper saves / total match goals >= 10.0 with at least 1 total match goal.
