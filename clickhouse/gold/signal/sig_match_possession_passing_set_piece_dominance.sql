-- ============================================================
-- Signal: sig_match_possession_passing_set_piece_dominance
-- Intent: Detect matches where restart-led circulation dominates total
--         passing volume, then orient output per side for bilateral analysis.
-- Trigger: match_dead_ball_restart_pass_share_pct > 20.
-- Notes: Dead-ball restart pass volume is proxied with
--        (player_throws + corners) because explicit free-kick pass counts
--        are not available in silver.period_stat.
