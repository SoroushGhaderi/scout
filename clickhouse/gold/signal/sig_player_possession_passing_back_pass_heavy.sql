-- Signal: sig_player_possession_passing_back_pass_heavy
-- Trigger: defender/midfielder records > 70% backward-or-sideways pass share, proxied by non-final-third passes.
-- Intent: identify deep or central players whose passing profile is dominated by retention/recycling rather than forward progression.
