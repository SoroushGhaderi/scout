-- Signal: sig_team_possession_passing_failed_penetration
-- Trigger: touches_opp_box >= 30 with shots_inside_box < 10 for the triggered side.
-- Intent: identify territorial dominance that fails to become high-quality box shooting output.
-- === sig_team_possession_passing_failed_penetration ===
-- Detects matches where a team achieves >= 30 touches in the opponent penalty box
-- yet records < 5 shots from inside the box — indicating high territorial penetration
-- without the cutting edge to generate meaningful shooting opportunities.
-- Signals final-third decision-making failure: overcrowding, crossing dependency,
-- or defensive compactness neutralising presence despite positional dominance.
