-- Signal: sig_match_shooting_goals_early_goal_late_goal
-- Intent: detect matches with at least one non-own goal in the opening 5 effective minutes and
--         at least one non-own goal in the final 5 regulation minutes (including stoppage-time),
--         then emit side-oriented finishing and control diagnostics.
-- Trigger: match_early_goal_count >= 1 and match_late_goal_count >= 1.
