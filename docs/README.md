# DepthMark Docs

Project-wide documentation lives in this folder so the repository root can stay
focused on onboarding.

- `DEVELOPMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`: architecture, layer boundaries, command surface,
  runbook, operations, and documentation ownership.
- `SCRIPTS_CONTRACT.md`: standards for script behavior, style, CLI semantics,
  logging, safety, and command-surface changes.
- `DATA_ENGINEERING_PROJECT_REVIEW_2026-05-17.md`: full DE review report with
  evidence-based findings and prioritized action plan.
- `DE_REVIEW_REMEDIATION_PLAN_2026-05-17.md`: prioritized remediation plan for
  the DE audit findings (P0-P3) and execution checklist.
- `DE_REVIEW_OPINION_2026-05-17.md`: reviewer opinion summary and audit activity
  log, including what was done and immediate next fix track.

Keep active subsystem contracts next to the code they govern. Current examples:

- `scripts/README.md`
- `scripts/gold/scenario/SCENARIOS_CONTRACT.md`
- `scripts/gold/signal/contracts/`
